        <p>What is future? In Wikipedia, future stands for the time after the present. </p>
<p>We can not know exactly what will happen tomorrow which is included in future, but we can discover the trends. Sometimes the prediction may not happen in the future or even against the future. Compared with prediction, trends are more reliable as they are not baseless. We have realised the importance of understanding the possible trends. This book mainly analyse the facts which have happened and reveal trends of development in technology and science.</p>
<p>In the first part, the author discusses the end of the era of abundance, which include using up the oil, clean drinkable water, food(especially the fish) and the other resources. After this, the author talks about the next wave of industry including 3D printing, Nanotechnology, genetic engineering, synthetic biology and the vertical farm. The basic logic behind these two parts is as the era of abundance will end in the near future, we need to develop science and technology to extend the life span of human beings civilisation(if all the resource is used, human can’t survive). We can conclude the first part as ‘Why do we need to develop science?’, while the second part as ‘What have happened in industry and what may happen’.</p>
<p>According to the two part I have read, I do not deny that the new technology can help us save and reuse resources in the future and the aim is to reduce loss of energy during production. From my point of view, we may need to pay more attention to sustainable development, like the reusing resources as much as possible, clean energy and less pollution. Reducing loss may be not useful in long run as the total resource we owning is invariable. By contrast, reusing resources can consider the resource we owning is unlimited because we can always reuse them if they are used in correct ways. </p>
<p>As Hegel says, ‘but what experience and history teach is this – that nations and governments have never learned anything from history or acted upon any lessons they might have drawn from it.’ He means people can never go into a same rive. Because we are at different time and meeting different problems, it is hard for us to follow the lessons which the history taught us. Both the author and I are analysing the trends of development. No one can judge who is correct or who is wrong through the history. The only thing I can do is to leave the right to judge to time. </p>
