<h1 id="Extract"><a href="#Extract" class="headerlink" title="Extract"></a>Extract</h1><h2 id="PartA-What-is-globalisation-and-What-is-good-about-it"><a href="#PartA-What-is-globalisation-and-What-is-good-about-it" class="headerlink" title="PartA What is globalisation, and What is good about it?"></a>PartA What is globalisation, and What is good about it?</h2><ul>
<li>Globalisation is the process by which markets become integrated among nations. Aspects of globalisation include international trade, foreign investment, and labour migration.</li>
<li>One reason why people engaged in international trade in centuries past was that hey wanted goods that weren’t available in their homelands.</li>
<li>The primary reason why countries continue to exchange goods and services is that they stand to gain a lot from specialisation and trade.</li>
<li>Globalisation and the concept of advantage<ul>
<li>Absolute advantage<ul>
<li>In economics, a country is said to have an absolute advantage in producing a particular good if it can do so at a lower absolute cost, or per-unit cost, than a trading partner can.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Comparative advantage<ul>
<li>David Ricardo, a British economist who lived in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, introduced the principle of comparative advantage.</li>
<li>A country has a comparative advantage in producing a particular good when that country can product the good at a lower opportunity cost than a trading partner can.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A particular country may not have an absolute advantage in reducing any one good, but every country has a comparative advantage over potential trading partners in producing some good.</li>
<li>Without international trade many of the goods we purchase on a regular basis would be more expensive. Free international trade has proven so beneficial that the majority of nations in the world have entered into free trade agreements with other nations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Globalisation and multinational corporations<ul>
<li>Another important aspect of globalisation has been the spread of the multinational corporation, which is a firm that operates and owns assets in more than one country.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Globalisation and currency valuations<ul>
<li>The foreign exchange market is where the currencies of the various nations are traded.</li>
<li>There was a time when most of the world’s currencies were pegged to gold. Later, for a period of time after World War II, the United States pegged the dollar to gold, and most other countries pegged their currencies to dollar.</li>
<li>Nowadays, sot currency values float freely, which means that their value is constantly changing in relation to other currencies.</li>
<li>Trade barriers<ul>
<li>Tariff is a tax that an importer has on imported goods.</li>
<li>Import quotas are limits on the amount of a good that can be imported.</li>
<li>Voluntary export restraints (VERs) are similar to import quotas with respect to their economic impart, but they’re not exactly imposed by the importing country.</li>
<li>Quality restrictions are restrictions based on the quality of goods to be imported.</li>
<li>Government subsidies to the domestic producers of a good.</li>
<li>An embargo, typically imposed for political reasons and not for the purpose of protecting domestic firms and industries, is a complete ban on trade with a particular nation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="PartB-Free-trade-agreements-and-other-forms-of-economic-integration"><a href="#PartB-Free-trade-agreements-and-other-forms-of-economic-integration" class="headerlink" title="PartB Free trade agreements and other forms of economic integration"></a>PartB Free trade agreements and other forms of economic integration</h2><ul>
<li>A free trade agreement is an arrangement among two or more nations to form what’s known as a free trade area.<ul>
<li>The participating countries agree to reduce or eliminate tariffs and other trade barriers on the goods that they trade among themselves while keeping trade barriers in place with countries that aren’t parties to the agreement.</li>
<li>Example: Latin American Integration Association, South Pacific Regional Trade and Economic Cooperation Agreement, and North American Free Trade Agreement<ul>
<li>Customer unions are like free trade agreements, but the participating countries also agree to adopt a common external tariff.</li>
<li>Common markets feature even greater integration as well as free movement of capital and labour across international borders.</li>
<li>Economic unions include all the integration involved in common markets in addition to unity where certain economic policies are concerned.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="PartC-Protectionism-the-flip-side-of-free-trade"><a href="#PartC-Protectionism-the-flip-side-of-free-trade" class="headerlink" title="PartC Protectionism: the flip side of free trade"></a>PartC Protectionism: the flip side of free trade</h2><ul>
<li>Sometimes free trade is restricted for geopolitical reasons. One country may choose not to trade with another because the two nations are political enemies.</li>
<li>Some trade barriers exist because a country wants to preserve a certain aspect of its cultural identity, which mean that it doesn’t want foreign products — and, by extension, foreign culture — to overtake its own culture.</li>
<li>Most trade barriers are erected because of political pressure from domestic producers who want to lessen competition from foreign producers.<ul>
<li>Infant industries</li>
<li>national defence</li>
<li>Retaliation</li>
<li>Employment rate</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="PartD-Possible-downsides-of-globalisation"><a href="#PartD-Possible-downsides-of-globalisation" class="headerlink" title="PartD Possible downsides of globalisation"></a>PartD Possible downsides of globalisation</h2><ul>
<li>As we’ve seen, when trade opens up across borders, there are bound to be winners and losers in the domestic economy. But as economic theory suggest, and as most economists agree, the total benefit for the domestic economy is likely to be greater than the total cost.</li>
<li>Promotion of income inequality<ul>
<li>Economic theory suggest that international trade should have an equalising effect on income over time, but empirical studies have produced mixed results.</li>
<li>It seems likely that the question of whether globalisation promotes economic equality or inequality will depend on the countries doing the trading and on the sorts of goods they are trading.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Corporate tax evasion<ul>
<li>Capital, whether financial capital or physical capital, tends to move to where it will bring the highest returns, and lower taxes generally imply higher returns.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Abuse of weaker nations by more powerful nations<ul>
<li>When abuses do occurs, they do so under the guise of regular international trade. But, just as trade barriers are not the best way to deal with forced labour and other abuses of human rights, it’s better to establish policies that target specific abuses of weaker nations by stronger ones, rather than attempting to tackle such abuse though broad protectionist policies that oppose globalisation as a whole.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Homogenisation of national cultures<ul>
<li>The fear that local cultures will dissipate or disappear is not unfounded, but it ha to be balanced against the benefits that societies gain from the cultural cross-pollination that has accompanies globalisation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="PartE-The-economics-of-immigration"><a href="#PartE-The-economics-of-immigration" class="headerlink" title="PartE The economics of immigration"></a>PartE The economics of immigration</h2><ul>
<li>Immigration does not appear to harm the economy, and in some ways it actually helps it.</li>
<li>In addition to boosting economic output and employment, immigration also helps the economy in another important way. Our native-born labour force has been shrinking — and will continue to shrink — relative to the number of retirees receiving Social Security benefits.</li>
<li>The economic benefits of globalisation are too great and will continue to be vast. There’s no doubt that as communication and transportation continue to become cheaper and faster, and as the cultures of the world continue to blend together, the world will just keep growing smaller and smaller.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Personal-thinking"><a href="#Personal-thinking" class="headerlink" title="Personal thinking"></a>Personal thinking</h1><p>I still remember that for the first time to learn about the international trade and the concept of absolute and comparative advantages, I found it difficult to understand why most countries follow comparative advantages instead of absolute advantage. After reading this chapter, some of the doubts have been solved. However, new questions come to my mind.</p>
<p>We all know that globalisation generates great benefits to the nations, especially when countries all specialise in the production which they have comparative advantages. However, why some countries still impose protectionism. I know that maybe the national defence and infant industry can be problems, but based on the theory of utility, they can not maximise the utility. As a result, is the government rational when making such decisions and announcing these policies? </p>
<p>These questions are hard to be solved because the actual utility can hardly be measured quantitively using the money as the unit. It is mentioned previously that the work of economist is to quantify these quantities, so I believe that these questions can be solved in the future or maybe have been solved but I don’t know that.</p>
