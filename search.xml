    <title>SOME RECORDS ON NEC</title>
    <url>/2020/12/21/NEC/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Last Sunday afternoon, 2020 21st Dec, I finished my NEC exam. </p>
<p>I have prepared for the exam since I decided to take part in it. When the words ‘EXAM IS OVER’ appeared on my screen, I was a little bit disappointed because there were many questions which I found I could not do anything with. </p>
<p>About four months ago, when I talked to my Economics teacher Ms.Cindy, I heard about NEC for the first time. She told me that NEC is National Economics Challenge and advantages and disadvantages of it. I decided to take part in it as I discovered that I am really interested in Economics.</p>
<p>Then, I discussed with my friends. We founded a group called ‘Together Group’ because we hoped that everyone in our group can always be together and support each other during preparation. </p>
<p>At the beginning, we four were all very positive, energetic and active. Tiffany found some lessons online, while Leo borrowed some books like Baron. Yuki and I collected and sorted all the materials we had. We even attended the CCA for NEC every Tuesday afternoon. This was the most impressive part in this activity, as Together Group gave me the feeling of a family.</p>
<p>Gradually, two of us started to lose confidence as other students are stronger than us in Economics. Yuki and I kept on taking classes and reading Mankind’s Principle of Economy. During this stage, I noticed that it became easier for me to understand some knowledge we learn in normal classes by Ms.Cindy.</p>
<p>Before the exam, I knew that it was almost impossible for my Together Group to get into next turn as it counted the top three marks in a group. However, I didn’t choose to give up because for a very long time I have believe that after the winter, there will always be the spring and when I do a thing, especially as a group member, I need to try my best to finish it because it is my responsibility and if I do, I can grow stronger. Several night before the exam, I stayed up late until mid-night and wrote a pile of notes. When collecting them after exam, strong sense of pride and achievement. </p>
<p>I haven’t get the result of the exam. However, I believed that everything will be well although we may not get into next turn to take part in the NEC China Finals, because I have done my best and insisted the belief in my heart for years.</p>
<p>From NEC Preliminary, I got to know that when I decide to do something, it is better for me to finish it without distractions, because when I act as this, I will become stronger and stronger. </p>

    <title>SOME RECORDS ON Physics Bowl</title>
    <url>/2021/04/15/Physics%20Bowl/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>On 27th March, around two o’clock in the afternoon, I finished 2021 Physics Bowl.</p>
<p>That was a nice afternoon which is windy and cloudy. The paper was not very hard as the Electromagnetism didn’t appear too many times which is my drawback among all pieces of knowledge. The boy sitting on my left, finished his paper very quickly and seemed to be very confident about his answers.</p>
<p>I was a little bit upset that day. Two things were always on my mind.</p>
<p>To be honest, during the long preparation for Physics Bowl, I gave up half way instead of insisting on training past papers and getting through the book after class. I still remembered the first lesson of Physics Bowl taken by me at the beginning of the first semester of Senior1. During that time, Physics was my favourite subject and I even set it as my target major in the university. However, I started to learn more about both Physics and Economics. Economics is a new subject to me which I refused to study before entry of senior high school but was deeply attracted after getting to understand some basic knowledge. By contrast, it was unbelievable that it began hard for me to understand the complicated concepts in Physics which ran out all my patience and interest. With further study in Economics competition, more time was devoted to Economics instead of Physics. It was a process that happened during a long period, but I still remembered clearly some small moments like I was almost driven crazy by Physics for the first time. From then on, I knew that the story between Physics and I may be near the ending. Another thing happened is that I did some program study those days and read more books about both Nature Science and Social Science especially Economics. A strange feeling of thirsty of concentrating more on Economics came to my heart due to the books I read. I talked to my parents, counsellor and Economics teacher several times. They all hoped that I could insist on what I really love. </p>
<p>AMC teaches me the real meaning of opportunity costs. Physics Bowl may teach me something about giving up. </p>
<p>Many teachers say I am a girl who has a strong demand for perfection, because it is common for me to take part in all the meaningful activities and play an active role in finishing tasks, in order to get satisfying result, even if I dislike the activities or lack time. During the preparation, everyday I was so busy to deal with every details in my life as many events had similar date, that it was difficult for me to calm down and go through the day again, so I decided to give up something to chill myself and reflect more. </p>
<p>I decided to give up Physics Bowl as a result of a lack of incentive of further study due to decreasing interest in Physics. Maybe we can regard this decision as a kind of releasing myself. </p>
<p>I would always be thankful for Physics Bowl as it helped me to discover that maybe it is so suitable for me to spend the rest of time learning Physics but Economics. Also, it provided me with a chance to think about giving up which is a thing I had never though about before. I don’t think that giving up equals to escaping. It is that choose to not choose something in our life because we may hope to choose other things. This is kind of admiration of being ourselves.</p>

    <title>SOME RECORDS ON AMC and AIME</title>
    <url>/2021/04/14/AMC/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>On 5th and 11th February, I finished my two AMC exams.</p>
<p>AMC is American Mathematics Competition. It is one of the most popular and welcomed maths competition all over the world. During primary school, I used to take part in AMC8 and receive a relative high score(Top 2.5%). As a result, after attending senior high school, AMC became one of my after-class activities as well, because I wanted to challenge myself through it. </p>
<p>During my process of preparation, I felt a little bit lonely from time to time, as there were only a few students in my class choosing to try AMC12 which is beyond the current syllabus.</p>
<p>I tried to talk with August who prepared for AMC12 too, about the exam preparing. We discussed questions from time to time after that. Now, we are good friends. This is the most impressive part of the activity. </p>
<p>I started to understand that although we may compete with each other during the competition, it is still important and possible for us to cooperate, as a result of friendship. Competition is more than competing. August and I received satisfied scores. I got 103.5points in AMC10A and 117points in AMC12B. </p>
<p>Additionally, through AMC, one thing has become clearer than before. The process of improving, challenging and studying may be lonely because everyone makes different decision during this period. For example, my best friend Estella chose to forgo AMC as she wanted to take part in FBLA more. Another example is that during the last preparing day, August and I still had a lot of things which we had not learnt and understood. We chose to study different areas.</p>
<p>From my point of view, the aloneness is one of the lessons we need to learn during our studying time. </p>
<p>Fortunately, I got the chance to take part in AIME(America Invitational Mathematics Examination). However, something unexpected happened. The date of AIME was conflicted with my school IGCSE mock examination. I said to myself several time, “Mock is more important as it is the first time for me to experience international examinations hold by CAIE and mock exam will be the source of GPA of this semester.” Every time the sense of not convinced also came to my heart as it really took me hours and hours learning maths knowledge and going through past papers. </p>
<p>Finally, I decided to give up preparing for AIME to save time for mock exams. After handing in my AIME paper, I got to know that this time I must have been failed to achieve anything. It was near 8 p.m. when AIME was done. Block 1912 opposite my school was still full of music sounds and colourful lights. Suddenly, one concept which I learnt in Economics came to my mind——opportunity cost and made me feel relived.</p>
<p>Everyone has limited time and energy, but I always long for finishing everything which is unattainable and impossible. As a result, it is necessary for me to make a decision on what to do. Opportunity cost is the next best choice foregone when making a decision. I still remember the words which were said by my Economics teacher Ms. Cindy when I told her that I would switch my future major from Physics to Economics. She said that, “Every decision or choice has an opportunity cost. I simply hope that you can consider the thing carefully before making a decision.”</p>
<p>Perhaps to Estella, she though FBLA was more important than AMC so she made such a decision that high prize was rewarded to her by FBLA but not so good performance was shown by her in AMC. To me, I still hope to achieve higher marks in IGCSE instead of AIME.</p>
<p>To sum up, I will always remember AMC and AIME of this year. They provides me with a chance to experience the concept of opportunity costs by myself instead of leaving it only as a piece of knowledge in my Economics books. </p>
<p>Meantime, after seeing the lights and hearing the sounds from Block 1912, I am not regretted about my decision anymore, although a total of only 4 marks was achieved by me in AIME, because I still realised that life sucks, so it may be better for me to be cute and enjoy and try to get understand the tastes of life more, instead of giving myself too much press to spend time seeing the around world.</p>

    <url>/2021/02/04/Tell%20us%20about%20who%20you%20are%20/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>My name is Yiran Dai. Others call me Sylvia. I am a student in Grade 10 at Nanjing Foreign Languages School International Curriculum Center.</p>
<p>I have spent 15 years living in Nanjing, which is my hometown. I have always longed to see the wide world outside Nanjing, so I have travelled gone to other places all over the world. For example, I visited the U.K. in 2017 with my friends. I can’t forget the beautiful views of the Thames. In addition, I enjoy playing the piano and the violin. Photography and reading interest me as well. </p>
<p>My family consists of my parents, two cats and me. My cats are fond of playing with me. Sometimes, I feed homeless cats in my school and community. My family regard me as an outgoing and kind girl.</p>
<p>I have a wide circle of friends. I organize activities and events for my class and school, such as the New Year Gala in my school. When we are stuck for fresh ideas, new ones come to me very quickly. When we face difficult problems, I help to come up with a solution quickly. They call me “the most creative female in the world”. When I asked my close friends why they had made friends with me, almost everyone told me that it was because I have a strong sense of ceremony. I remember their birthdays, anniversaries and important events and send messages to them. Additionally, I built friendships with my Physics and Economics teachers. They always praise me for my accurate self-assessment and efforts made in each subject.</p>
<p>I am really proud of myself in two respects. Firstly, as I mentioned above, I am capable of organising large events. I am happy to act as a leader. Secondly, although I am always in a hurry every day, I spare some time to listen patiently to others and to talk to them.</p>
<p>This is me, a girl who is both thoughtful and sensitive.</p>

    <title>Thinking on The Fuzzy and The Techie</title>
    <url>/2021/02/14/Thinking%20on%20The%20Fuzzy%20and%20The%20Techie/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>This book mainly talks about the relationship between the Liberal Arts and digital world.</p>
<p>What is the Liberal Arts? Liberal arts generally covers four areas including the natural sciences, social sciences, arts and humanities. At present, there are some liberal arts colleges in the U.S.A. which are undergraduate institutions of high education, for example the Wellesley College. From my point of view, liberal arts plays an essential role in our society. First of all, liberal arts can also be described as “psychology”. All the liberal arts majors aim to research the way in which humans consider things and the influence on the society caused by these consideration. From example, Economics is the study which looks for the mentality of the consumers, producers and governments in a specific market. In addition, liberal arts also represents interdisciplinary study and research. A liberal arts education encourages students to integrates different areas of study, making students to explore a variety of subjects. This results in students can consider one problem from multiple perspectives.</p>
<p>What is STEM? STEM stands for science, technology, engineering and maths. These subjects promote the development of technology which has a wider meaning than the technology in STEM. This will result in a better living standard. For example, it is possible for us to print a house in a relative short time with a 3D printer which requires a long time with plenty of workers to finish.</p>
<p>I must point out that STEM and liberal arts coincide in some areas. For example, they both cover the natural science which include chemistry, physics and other subjects. </p>
<p>The first thing I want to talk about is the interdisciplinary studies. This is defined as the combination of two or more academic disciplines into one activity. When it happens, something is created by thinking across boundaries between different subjects. At present, a variety of interdisciplinary studies appears in our society for example the PPE ( Politics, Philosophy and Economics) and HSPS (Human, Social, and Political Sciences). During interdisciplinary studies, students can easily develop the skills of critical thinking, communication, creative problem solving, self-expression, innovative research and lifelong learning. This can promote the digital worlds as when we start an Internet company, everything needs to be considered detailedly without any mistakes. These skills will work. The study of liberal arts is mainly the interdisciplinary studies. To sum up, from the aspect of the interdisciplinary studies and the skills, the liberal arts is able to promote digital world.</p>
<p>The nest thing drawing my attention is the replacement by the technology. In the book, the author describes the situation in which the some workers are replaced by the technology, for example, the proportion of farmers has decreased a lot during the past century in America because of the development of automation. I still remembered the words which were said by my junior high school head teacher Mr. Cao. He said that in the future, we needed to concentrate in one areas to be more professional, because this could help us avoid being replaced by others. With the development of technology, the main problem has turned from replacement by the other workers to replacement by the technology. The times changed. Our competitor has changed from people to machines. I don’t mean that we need to reject all the technology. The most important thing is how to balance the relationship between technology and workers. From my point of view, overuse of technology may result in an increase in unemployment. Unskilled people may find it more and more difficult to earn a living. Skilled people must be more and more professional to keep their job. However, liberal arts can solve this problem in some ways. If everyone takes liberal arts, they will learn to think independently and critically. This results in that everyone has clear direction of self-development. Digital world can progress better in such social environment.</p>
<p>The last thing is people oriented. Why is liberal arts important? Except the reasons mentioned above, another vital reason is that liberal arts is kind of human based. In modern society, the technology can work out a variety of solutions of a problem, but it is difficult for them to choose, because the choices are made with consideration for a lot of factors, not only the costs and opportunity costs, as our society is made up of over seven billion people. A company which has workers can not survive without people oriented. After a long-time squeeze, people may do some crazy things. Everything will change, if the company is people oriented, Google discovered that if bosses greeted workers enthusiastically in the morning, the productivity would show an increase. </p>
<p>In conclusion, the liberal arts plays a positive role in the Digital World. However, I think liberal arts can influence all the fields optimistically because of its features. </p>

    <title>Thinking on One Two Three…Infinite</title>
    <url>/2021/01/26/Thinking%20on%20One%20Two%20Three%E2%80%A6Infinite%20/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>What is infinity? In wikipedia, infinity represents something that is boundless or endless, or else something that is larger than any real or natural number. </p>
<p>To be honest, I don’t understand every detail in the book. Although this book was written about a half century ago, some knowledge is not the most famous at the moment. However, this book is still not out of date actually. </p>
<p>To begin with counting, or maybe how to count, the author describes the ways which the ancient people followed to count. Meantime, he introduces some examples of enormous numbers. At last, he tells us several interesting definitions, like prime number and imaginary number, and famous theorem, like Fermat’s last theorem. </p>
<p>In the second chapter, the author introduces the four-dimensional space. This part becomes more difficult for me to understand as I have a poor ability of imagining. However, some interesting things attracted my attention. The four colour theorem reminds me of the geography lesson which I had during junior high school. That is the first time for me to get to know something about Topology. </p>
<p>The most unforgettable thing in the first two parts is an annotation given by the translator. The annotation is given during the author describe the four colour theorem. It says “This theorem has been proved during 1970s by the computer.” </p>
<p>What does this mean?</p>
<p>We all know that science has been developed rapidly in the past century. More and more theorems help people extend the science research. It becomes more difficult for non-professional people to learn, although in modern society, more convenient ways have been designed to learn new knowledge. Online reading is a good example. It is worth noting that, in these years, the things which have been develop do not only include science and technology, but also the ability of people to learn. This may be another thing the author want to tell us. That is the ability of people to learn is infinity as well. Humans have great potential energy to develop further in all the fields.</p>

<li><p>Definition: It occurs when individuals, firms, regions or countries concentrate on the production of a particular good or  service. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Individuals</p>
<ul>
<li>Become more skilled and efficient at their jobs, and increase both quality and quantity of the goods and serviced produced</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Firms</p>
</li>
<li><p>Regions</p>
</li>
<li><p>Countries</p>
<ul>
<li>Definition: International specialisation occurs when countries concentrate on the production of certain goods or services due to cost advantages (cheaper production methods) and their abundance of superior resources. </li>
<li>Influenced by the quantity and quality of their resources</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Advantages-of-specialisation"><a href="#Advantages-of-specialisation" class="headerlink" title="Advantages of specialisation"></a>Advantages of specialisation</h3><ul>
<li><p>For consumers</p>
<ul>
<li>Enjoy more goods and services and higher living standards as an increase in output</li>
<li>Better quality of the product as an improvement in skills and techniques</li>
<li>Lower price as the average costs of production decrease</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>For firms</p>
<ul>
<li>Take the advantages of economies of scale</li>
<li>Be able to buy raw materials from specialist firms which are producing high quality raw materials at low costs</li>
<li>Trade helps firms in the exchange of new management ideas, information about the new products and new technology</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>For the economy</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase efficiency and economic welfare</li>
<li>Real GDP should be relative high and output would be higher</li>
<li>Consume outside its PPC</li>
<li>Consume more goods and services to raise living standards and reduce relative poverty</li>
<li>Resources will not be lying idle</li>
<li>Keep inflation rate relatively low</li>
<li>Build up reputation in producing particular product to attract more sales and ancillary industries to set up in the country and boost its sales of exports </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Disadvantages-of-specialisation"><a href="#Disadvantages-of-specialisation" class="headerlink" title="Disadvantages of specialisation"></a>Disadvantages of specialisation</h3><ul>
<li><p>For consumers</p>
<ul>
<li>One or some countries may gain control of most of the global market and restrict supply to push up the price</li>
<li>May not follow the same health and safety standards as the home country</li>
<li>Any problems happened in the country may stop the country from producing so in the short run the product is not available</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>For firms</p>
<ul>
<li>Too dependent on other counties for the markets of the products they produce and for the sources of their raw materials</li>
<li>May experience a fall in demand as tastes may change or foreign counties become more efficient or a substitute may be developed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>For the economy</p>
<ul>
<li>Hard to determine what an economy is best at producing and what will be in demand in the future</li>
<li>If demand suddenly falls or costs rise, the country may run into difficulties and results in structural unemployment</li>
<li>High transport costs may also offset any costs advantage a country has in producing</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Absolute-amp-Comparative-advantage"><a href="#Absolute-amp-Comparative-advantage" class="headerlink" title="Absolute&amp;Comparative advantage"></a>Absolute&amp;Comparative advantage</h3><ul>
<li>Definition: Absolute advantage is a country can produce the product using fewer resources than other countries</li>
<li>Definition: Comparative advantage is a country can produce the product at a lower opportunity costs than other countries</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Trade"><a href="#Trade" class="headerlink" title="Trade"></a>Trade</h3><ul>
<li><p>Definition: International trade refers to the exchange of goods and services beyond national borders. It entails the sale of exports (goods and services sold to overseas buyers) and imports (foreign goods and services bought by domestic households and firms).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Definition: Free trade means that international trade can take place without any forms of protection (barriers to international trade), such as quantitative limits or taxes being imposed on exports.</p>
<ul>
<li>Advantages </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Connection between specialisation and international trade</p>
<ul>
<li>Producing a relatively narrow range of products will mean that countries will have to export some of their output. This is necessary for them to gain revenue for spending on imports of products that their citizens want to buy, but their countries are not producing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Globalisation</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Definition: Globalisation is the process by which the world’s economies become increasingly interdependent and interconnected due to greater international trade and cultural exchanges. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Consequences</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Advantages</p>
<ul>
<li>With increasing international trade, creating wealth and jobs throughout the world</li>
<li>Increasing competition results in more products at relatively low prices</li>
<li>Encourage firms to locate their production in most efficient locations</li>
<li>Freer movement of labour, capital, goods and services</li>
<li>Firms can enjoy economies of scale</li>
<li>More choices of goods and services</li>
<li>Greater cultural understanding and appreciation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Disadvantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Greater dependence on global economy(A recession in one economy can have significant impact on other economies)</li>
<li>Some workers may lose their jobs because of increased competition</li>
<li>Increase the importance of occupational mobility</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Multinational company(MNC)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>An MNC in an organisation that operates in two or more countries. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Advantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Foreign country–Through job creation, improve standards of living in the countries</li>
<li>Firms&amp;consumers–MNCs enjoy economies of scale so MNCs can pass on cost savings to their consumers in form of lower prices</li>
<li>Firms&amp;home country–By operating in overseas market, MNCs are able to generate more profits because of an increase in consumer base(profit are repatriated so home country benefits)</li>
<li>Firms&amp;foreign country–MNCs move or expand their operations in foreign countries to benefit from lower rates of corporation tax.</li>
<li>Firms–Spread risks by operating overseas</li>
<li>Firms–Avoid any trade restrictions</li>
<li>Firms–Access new markets by locating overseas and reduce transportation costs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Disadvantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Workers–Unethical and cost-cutting practises</li>
<li>Local companies–MNCs can force local firms that are less competitive to close down because of their huge market power and ability to exploit economies of scale</li>
<li>Local government–They are often in a powerful position to exploit foreign governments over decisions</li>
<li>Local country–Higher unemployment</li>
<li>Local country–Over-reliance on MNCs in low income countries means there are major consequences should an MNC choose to relocate the operation</li>
<li>MNCs– Hard to manage the overall business because of a lack of effective communications</li>
<li>MNCs– Fluctuating exchange rate makes it difficult to measure and compare the value of MNCs’ sales and profits</li>
<li>MNCs– May not provide goods and services appealed to local tastes and consumers</li>

<li><p>Tariff</p>
<ul>
<li>It is a tax on imports.</li>
<li>Tariff increases the cost of production and the price of imports in domestic market, so the quantity of imports reduces</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Import quotas</p>
<ul>
<li>It sets a quantitative limit on the scale of a foreign goods in a country.</li>
<li>Quota limits the quantity imported</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Subsidies</p>
<ul>
<li>Government can provide subsidies to domestic firms to compete against importers</li>
<li>Subsidies lower the costs of production for home firms</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Embargo</p>
<ul>
<li>It is a ban on trade with a certain country, due to a trade dispute or political conflict</li>
<li>An embargo rarely benefits local consumers as they suffer from a lack of choices and higher prices</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Exchange control</p>
<ul>
<li>A government try to decrease import through restricting the availability of foreign currency</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Quality standards</p>
<ul>
<li>A country may ask imports to reach artificially high standards results in dissuading other countries from selling or pushing up prices</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Expensive paperwork</p>
<ul>
<li>Require foreign firms to fill out a considerable amount of time-consuming paperwork</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Voluntary export restraints(VERs)</p>
<ul>
<li>A government may persuade the foreign government to agree to restrict the number of units of a product sold by it</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Consequences"><a href="#Consequences" class="headerlink" title="Consequences"></a>Consequences</h3><ul>
<li><p>Advantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Help the infant industries from foreign competition and safeguard domestic jobs, because in extreme cases, fierce competition from foreign rivals can even force domestic firms out of business.</li>
<li>Prevent foreign countries dumping(occurs when foreign firms sell their products in large quantities at prices deliberately below those charged by domestic firms, often even below the cost of production)</li>
<li>Increase government revenue</li>
<li>Overcome a balance of payment deficit as restricting imports will help to deal with it</li>
<li>To protect strategic industries instead of relying on foreign countries</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Disadvantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Government intervention may distort market signals and results in an international misallocation of resources. The domestic companies may become too reliant on government and become inefficient</li>
<li>Decreasing competition and incentive for innovation may lead to an increase in price. Costs of raw materials may increase as well and results in imported inflation</li>
<li>Other countries may react with retaliating and imposing their own barriers. This may hinder global economic growth and prosperity</li>
</ul>

<li><p>Definition</p>
<ul>
<li>This is a record of all exports and imports of goods and services between a country and the rest of the world, plus net income transfers from abroad. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Components</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Trade in goods(visible)</p>
<ul>

<li><p>Definition: It is the value of exported services and the value of imported services</p>
</li>
<li><p>Example: American tourists fly to the UK on British Airways</p>

</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Trade in services surplus</p>
<ul>
<li>expenditure on imported services&gt;revenue from exported services</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Primary income</p>
<ul>
<li>Definition: It is the income earned by people working in different countries and investment income which comes into and goes out of the country</li>
<li>Example: Money sent home by people working abroad</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Secondary income</p>
<ul>
<li>Definition: It is the transfers between residents and non-residents of money, goods or services, not in return for anything else</li>
<li>Example: Scholarships paid to students based in overseas universities</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Deficit</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Definition: A current account deficit occurs when its import expenditure is greater than its export earnings(the current account has a negative balance)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Causes</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Lower demand for exports</p>
<ul>
<li>A decline in manufacturing competitiveness(may caused by higher labour costs domestically)</li>
<li>A decline income in foreign market(may due to a decrease in available money caused by an economic recession)</li>
<li>An increase in exchange rate which makes exports more expensive and reduce the volume and value of exports</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Higher demand for imports</p>
<ul>
<li>Cheaper or better quality of imports(cheaper may due to a decrease in exchange rate)</li>
<li>Domestic inflation which makes imports relatively cheaper</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Consequences</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Advantages</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Lower exchange rate</p>
<ul>
<li>The demand for the domestic currency decreases so the exchange rate decreases and exports become more competitive</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Disadvantages</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Reduced demand</p>
<ul>
<li>As the economy is spending more on imports that it is receiving, the demand in economy will fall and a recession may be triggered</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Unemployment</p>
<ul>
<li>A fall in overall demand may cause cyclical unemployment. Also, the wages may decrease</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Lower standards of living</p>
<ul>
<li>The deficit may be caused by capital outflows exceed capital inflows. The economy may suffer from lower standards of living as income is less. Also, households and firms may need to reduce spending</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Increased borrowing</p>
<ul>
<li>Deficit means spending more than income. Government needs to borrow money to overcome the difference which results in interest and repayment of the loan(any money which government spends has an opportunity cost)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Surplus</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Definition: A current account deficit occurs when its export earning is greater than its import expenditure(the current account has a positive balance)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Causes</p>
<ul>
<li><p>High demand for exports</p>
<ul>
<li>An improvement in manufacturing competitiveness(may caused by higher labour productivity in domestic economy)</li>
<li>Higher incomes in overseas markets</li>
<li>A decrease in exchange rate</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Low demand for imports</p>
<ul>
<li>Imports are more expensive or of a lower quality</li>
<li>Inflation in overseas countries causes import tend to be expensive</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Consequences</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Advantages</p>
<ul>
<li>A fall in unemployment in domestic economy, but an increase in unemployment in other countries</li>
<li>The country receive high income because the home country has a competitive advantage in the product they export and result in a better living standards</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Disadvantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Higher demand for exports may lead to demand-pull inflation and diminish the international competitiveness</li>
<li>Higher demand for exports can cause the currency to appreciate in value and foreign buyers will find it more expensive to import goods into their countries.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Policies to achieve balance of payment stability</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Fiscal policy</p>
<ul>
<li>Higher taxes and reduced government spending to decrease the amount of money available to spend on imports</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Monetary policy</p>
<ul>
<li>Floating–Higher interest rates make new and existing loans more expensive for households and firms to reduce demand for imports</li>
<li>Fixed– The central monetary authority of a country might decide to devalue the exchange rate to improve the nation’s competitiveness</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Supply-side policy</p>
<ul>
<li>To raise the productive capacity</li>
<li>Investment in education and healthcare services to improve human capital, productivity and competitiveness</li>
<li>Investment in infrastructure to support</li>
<li>Encourage export-drive business start-ups and industries</li>

<h3 id="Floating-exchange-rate"><a href="#Floating-exchange-rate" class="headerlink" title="Floating exchange rate"></a>Floating exchange rate</h3><ul>
<li><p>Definition: In floating exchange rate, the value of the currency is determined by the market forces of demand for the currency and supply of the currency</p>
</li>
<li><p>Change in exchange rate</p>
<ul>
<li>Definition: An appreciation in the exchange rate if the exchange rate is rising against other currencies</li>
<li>Definition: A depreciation in the exchange rate if the exchange rate is falling against other currencies</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Fixed-exchange-rate"><a href="#Fixed-exchange-rate" class="headerlink" title="Fixed exchange rate"></a>Fixed exchange rate</h3><ul>
<li><p>Definition: In a fixed exchange rate system, the government intervenes in foreign exchange markets to maintain its exchange rate at a predetermined level</p>
</li>
<li><p>Main advantage: reducing the uncertainties for international trade makes domestic and foreign firms to be certain about future costs and prices and encourages international trade and exchange</p>
</li>
<li><p>This is achieved by the respective government buying and selling foreign currencies</p>

<h3 id="Causes-of-exchange-rate-fluctuations"><a href="#Causes-of-exchange-rate-fluctuations" class="headerlink" title="Causes of exchange rate fluctuations"></a>Causes of exchange rate fluctuations</h3><ul>
<li><p>Floating exchange rate system</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Changes in demand for exports: An increase in the demand for export will increase the demand for the country’s currency and increase the exchange rate</p>
</li>
<li><p>Changes in demand for imports: An increase in the demand for import will increase the demand for foreign currency and increase the value of foreign currency</p>
</li>
<li><p>Prices and inflation: An increase in the price of goods and services caused by domestic inflation will decrease the demand for exports</p>
</li>
<li><p>Foreign direct investment(FDI): Investment in overseas production plant requires the use of foreign currencies</p>
<ul>
<li>Inward FDI(eg. the entry of an MNC)will boost the demand for a currency</li>
<li>Outward FDI(eg. departure of an MNC)will increase the supply of a currency</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Speculation: foreign exchange traders and investment companies move money around the world to take advantage of higher interest rates and variations in exchange rates to earn a profit. As huge sums of money(hot money)are involved, speculation can cause exchange rate fluctuations. They might lack confidence and therefore withdraw their investment and depreciate the currency</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Fixed exchange rate system</p>
<ul>
<li>Government intervention</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Consequences-of-appreciation-and-revaluation"><a href="#Consequences-of-appreciation-and-revaluation" class="headerlink" title="Consequences of appreciation and revaluation"></a>Consequences of appreciation and revaluation</h3><ul>
<li><p>Advantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Consumers will have greater purchasing power</li>
<li>Importers gain from a strong dollar because the raw materials, components and finished goods will be cheaper. But this is bad for domestic producers</li>
<li>As unemployment decreases, the inflation rate will decrease. Also, if the country relies heavily on imports, the higher exchange rate will reduce general price level</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Disadvantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Exporters may face difficulties as exchange rate increases caused by their goods and services become more expensive for foreign consumers</li>
<li>A fall in net exports and deteriorating profits will cause job losses in export-oriented businesses and increase unemployment</li>
<li>In the long run, as a result of the higher exchange rate, economic growth is likely to fall due to the combination of lower export sales and higher unemployment.</li>
<li>If a currency appreciation has a larger impact on exports than imports (that is, there is a fall in the value of net exports), then the balance of payments will worsen, as a strong currency will make it more difficult for exporters to sell their goods and services in overseas markets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Coping-with-a-strong-exchange-rate"><a href="#Coping-with-a-strong-exchange-rate" class="headerlink" title="Coping with a strong exchange rate"></a>Coping with a strong exchange rate</h3><ul>
<li>Cutting export prices to maintain their price competitiveness against foreign rivals</li>
<li>Seeking alternative suppliers of cheaper raw materials</li>
<li>Improving productivity to keep costs of production low</li>
<li>Provide more price inelastic demand products as consumers are not sensitive with price change caused by exchange fluctuations</li>
<li>Improving non-price factors, including brand awareness and social responsibility</li>
<li>Relocate the production process overseas</li>

<ul>
<li>It is the extra benefit provided to workers by their employers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Job security</p>
<ul>
<li>A high degree of job security means that workers are unlikely to be made redundant</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Size of firms</p>
<ul>
<li>People are often attracted to jobs in large firms and organisations as they provide more wages and better career prospects, job security and fringe benefits</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Wage determinant</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Labour demand</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The demand for labour refers to the number of workers that firms are willing and able to employ at a given wage rate. Demand for labour is a derived demand(demand for the goods and services it produced, not for itself)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Determination factors</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Price for which that output can be sold</p>
</li>
<li><p>Labour productivity</p>
<ul>
<li>The demand for workers increases as their productivity increases, as higher productivity increases the return from hiring workers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Demand for the product</p>
<ul>
<li>As the demand for labour is a derived demand. The demand for the goods and services increases, so the demand for labour to produce them will increase</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Costs of other factors of production</p>
<ul>
<li>An increase in the price of capital may increase the demand for workers as it is possible to substitute labour for capital</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Labour supply</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The supply for the labour in an economy consists of people who are of working age and who are both willing and able to work at different wage rates.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Determinantion factors</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Number of labour force</p>
<ul>
<li>A fall in labour force will make an individual business more difficult to recruit workers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Qualifications or length of training required to do the job</p>
<ul>
<li>An increase in requirement for qualifications will make the supply of the labour low as the number of people with the willingness and ability to undertake a long period of challenging training is low</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Non-wage benefits of the job</p>
<ul>
<li>A decrease in non-wage benefits may reduce people’s willingness to do it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Wage or non-wage benefits in other jobs</p>
<ul>
<li>A rise in the benefits in other jobs will encourage some workers to switch from one occupation to another</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Relative bargaining power of employment workers</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Wages are likely to be higher in occupations where workers have strong bargaining power</p>
</li>
<li><p>Trade unions</p>
<ul>
<li>Trade union will use their bargaining strength to negotiate on behalf of their members. A change in trade union’s bargaining power and willingness to take industrial action can affect</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Level of education</p>
<ul>
<li>A higher level of education will increase the worker’s bargaining power</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Age and experience</p>
<ul>
<li>An increase in age and experience can increase the worker’s bargaining power and its higher wages.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Government policies</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Clearly influences the wages of those workers whom it employs in the public sector</p>
</li>
<li><p>Specific government policies may have an impact on particular occupations</p>
</li>
<li><p>Directly affect wages–National Minimum Wage</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Results</p>
<ul>
<li>If the government introduces an NMW which is above the equilibrium wage, the quantity supplied will extend and the quantity demanded will contract. A surplus of labour appears and results in unemployment</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Consequences</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Advantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Workers have a fair or liveable wages and are not exploited by the employers</li>
<li>Create incentive for the unemployed to work</li>
<li>Low income earners have more money to spend and increase consumption and ease the fears higher wages will cause unemployment</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Disadvantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Workers who earn more than NMW may ask for a higher wage to maintain the wage differential</li>
<li>Unemployment may increase as an increase in costs of labour make firms to purchase more capital goods</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Public opinion</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider that jobs which involve long periods of study and training should be highly rewarded</li>
<li>Influence the wages claims made by the workers</li>
<li>Put pressure on a government to revise the wages it pays to the public sector workers</li>
<li>Attitudes towards women. If social attitudes are against working women, it is harder for women to find employment and may receive significantly less pay than male counterparts</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Discrimination</p>
<ul>
<li>It occurs when a group of workers is treated unfavourable in terms of employment, the wage rate, the training received and promotional opportunities</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Stages of production</p>
<ul>
<li><p>People work in primary sector may usually less well-paid than those who work in secondary and tertiary sectors.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Reasons</p>
<ul>
<li>Workers in primary sector tend to be less skilled and have fewer qualifications</li>
<li>With the development of the economy, the demand for primary sector workers usually declines</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Earnings of individuals over time</p>
<ul>
<li>The longer people work, the more skilled and productive they tend to become. An increase in productivity is caused by gaining experience and undertake training</li>
<li>Some older workers may decide to give up working overtime and some may switch to less demanding work, so the wages and bonuses reduces</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Extent to which earnings change</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Determinant of elasticity of demand for labour</p>
<ul>
<li>Proportion of labour costs in total costs</li>
<li>Ease with which labour can be substituted by capital</li>
<li>Elasticity of demand for the product produced</li>
<li>Time period</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Determinant of elasticity of supply of labour</p>
<ul>
<li>Qualifications and skills required</li>
<li>Length of training period</li>
<li>Level of employment</li>
<li>Mobility of labour</li>
<li>Degree of vacation</li>
<li>Time period</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Division and specialisation of labour</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Specialization</p>
<ul>
<li>It occurs when a worker become an experts in a particular profession</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Division</p>
<ul>
<li>It occurs when a production process or task is split between different workers who become experts in a part of the process</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Consequences</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Advantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Workers become experts in their field, so the productivity and efficiency increases. The average costs of production decreases</li>
<li>Quality of the products or services increases</li>
<li>Workers become more skilled so their earning potential increases</li>
<li>Create higher motivation, productivity, output and competitiveness for the firms</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Disadvantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Workers may get bored, make more mistakes and decrease productivity</li>
<li>Workers may become alienated</li>
<li>Become too dependent on an individual workers and be hard to cover for the workers who are off sick or under training</li>
<li>Workers become deskilled in other areas and results in a lack of occupational immobility</li>

<ul>
<li><p>Advantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Promote efficiency</li>
<li>Low prices due to competition </li>
<li>Produce according to consumers’ wants</li>
<li>Wider choices for consumers due to higher number of sellers</li>
<li>Good quality goods because of incentive to sell more</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Disadvantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Price may not be so low as they can not enjoy economies of scale because small scale</li>
<li>The choices may be only in sellers instead of a variety of products because of homogeneous products</li>
</ul>

<li><p>Monopoly</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It is a sole supplier of a product have 100% share of the market.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Characteristic</p>

<ul>
<li>Earn supernormal profits</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Performance</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Advantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Enjoy economies of scale. This means they can have low average costs of production and have  international competitiveness against foreign competitiors</li>
<li>Have financial resources to invest in innovation. Research and development expenditure can help to generate new ideas, products and production processes. Innovation can act as a source of profit and improve productive capacity</li>
<li>Eliminate wasteful competition. This is because profit-seeking firms may not have much of a financial incentive to provide services in remote areas of the country and a single provider can gain huge economies of scale. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Disadvantages</p>
<ul>
<li>No substitutes. The demand is price inelastic so they can charge higher prices due to price makers to maximise profits</li>
<li>High barriers may prevent new firms. This limits the degree of competition and ensure monopolists continue to charge high prices</li>
<li>Less incentive to innovate. Because of a lack of competitive pressure, they may become complacent rather than focusing on innovations</li>
<li>Market failure. This will result in an inefficient allocation of resources</li>

<li><p>Growth</p>
<ul>
<li>An increase in size may bring advantages like economies of scale</li>
<li>Those who run firms may want the growth as their pay and status may be closely linked to the size of the firm and increase gob security</li>

<h3 id="Factors-affecting-the-strength-of-a-trade-union"><a href="#Factors-affecting-the-strength-of-a-trade-union" class="headerlink" title="Factors affecting the strength of a trade union"></a>Factors affecting the strength of a trade union</h3><ul>
<li><p>A high number of members</p>
<ul>
<li>The more the members a union has, the more funds it has to finance its activities. </li>
<li>It is difficult to replace union labour by non-union labour.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>A high level of skills</p>
<ul>
<li>Unions with skilled workers are in a relative strong position as it is difficult to replace skilled workers with other skilled workers and expensive to train unskilled workers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>A consistent demand for product produced by the workers</p>
<ul>
<li>Unions that represent workers making essential goods and services are in strong position to bargain</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Favourable government legislation</p>
<ul>
<li>If the governments allow industrial action, the trade union will be in a stronger position</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>A high level of economic activity</p>
<ul>
<li>If output and income in a country increase, more industries may perform well, so wages and non-wage factors may improve. Also, when output reaches high levels and most people are employed, firms may compete for workers. So bargaining power increases</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Ways"><a href="#Ways" class="headerlink" title="Ways"></a>Ways</h3><ul>
<li><p>Collective bargaining</p>

<li><p>Work to rule</p>
<ul>
<li>Workers deliberately slow down production by complying rigidly with every rule and regulation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Go-slow</p>
<ul>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
