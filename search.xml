    <title>SOME RECORDS ON NEC</title>
    <url>/2020/12/21/AR%202020-12-21NEC/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Last Sunday afternoon, 2020 21st Dec, I finished my NEC exam. </p>
<p>I have prepared for the exam since I decided to take part in it. When the words ‘EXAM IS OVER’ appeared on my screen, I was a little bit disappointed because there were many questions which I found I could not do anything with. </p>
<p>About four months ago, when I talked to my Economics teacher Ms.Cindy, I heard about NEC for the first time. She told me that NEC is National Economics Challenge and advantages and disadvantages of it. I decided to take part in it as I discovered that I am really interested in Economics.</p>
<p>Then, I discussed with my friends. We founded a group called ‘Together Group’ because we hoped that everyone in our group can always be together and support each other during preparation. </p>
<p>At the beginning, we four were all very positive, energetic and active. Tiffany found some lessons online, while Leo borrowed some books like Baron. Yuki and I collected and sorted all the materials we had. We even attended the CCA for NEC every Tuesday afternoon. This was the most impressive part in this activity, as Together Group gave me the feeling of a family.</p>
<p>Gradually, two of us started to lose confidence as other students are stronger than us in Economics. Yuki and I kept on taking classes and reading Mankind’s Principle of Economy. During this stage, I noticed that it became easier for me to understand some knowledge we learn in normal classes by Ms.Cindy.</p>
<p>Before the exam, I knew that it was almost impossible for my Together Group to get into next turn as it counted the top three marks in a group. However, I didn’t choose to give up because for a very long time I have believe that after the winter, there will always be the spring and when I do a thing, especially as a group member, I need to try my best to finish it because it is my responsibility and if I do, I can grow stronger. Several night before the exam, I stayed up late until mid-night and wrote a pile of notes. When collecting them after exam, strong sense of pride and achievement. </p>
<p>I haven’t get the result of the exam. However, I believed that everything will be well although we may not get into next turn to take part in the NEC China Finals, because I have done my best and insisted the belief in my heart for years.</p>
<p>From NEC Preliminary, I got to know that when I decide to do something, it is better for me to finish it without distractions, because when I act as this, I will become stronger and stronger. </p>

    <title>SOME RECORDS ON Physics Bowl</title>
    <url>/2021/04/15/AR%202021-04-15Physics%20Bowl/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>On 27th March, around two o’clock in the afternoon, I finished 2021 Physics Bowl.</p>
<p>That was a nice afternoon which is windy and cloudy. The paper was not very hard as the Electromagnetism didn’t appear too many times which is my drawback among all pieces of knowledge. The boy sitting on my left, finished his paper very quickly and seemed to be very confident about his answers.</p>
<p>I was a little bit upset that day. Two things were always on my mind.</p>
<p>To be honest, during the long preparation for Physics Bowl, I gave up half way instead of insisting on training past papers and getting through the book after class. I still remembered the first lesson of Physics Bowl taken by me at the beginning of the first semester of Senior1. During that time, Physics was my favourite subject and I even set it as my target major in the university. However, I started to learn more about both Physics and Economics. Economics is a new subject to me which I refused to study before entry of senior high school but was deeply attracted after getting to understand some basic knowledge. By contrast, it was unbelievable that it began hard for me to understand the complicated concepts in Physics which ran out all my patience and interest. With further study in Economics competition, more time was devoted to Economics instead of Physics. It was a process that happened during a long period, but I still remembered clearly some small moments like I was almost driven crazy by Physics for the first time. From then on, I knew that the story between Physics and I may be near the ending. Another thing happened is that I did some program study those days and read more books about both Nature Science and Social Science especially Economics. A strange feeling of thirsty of concentrating more on Economics came to my heart due to the books I read. I talked to my parents, counsellor and Economics teacher several times. They all hoped that I could insist on what I really love. </p>
<p>AMC teaches me the real meaning of opportunity costs. Physics Bowl may teach me something about giving up. </p>
<p>Many teachers say I am a girl who has a strong demand for perfection, because it is common for me to take part in all the meaningful activities and play an active role in finishing tasks, in order to get satisfying result, even if I dislike the activities or lack time. During the preparation, everyday I was so busy to deal with every details in my life as many events had similar date, that it was difficult for me to calm down and go through the day again, so I decided to give up something to chill myself and reflect more. </p>
<p>I decided to give up Physics Bowl as a result of a lack of incentive of further study due to decreasing interest in Physics. Maybe we can regard this decision as a kind of releasing myself. </p>
<p>I would always be thankful for Physics Bowl as it helped me to discover that maybe it is so suitable for me to spend the rest of time learning Physics but Economics. Also, it provided me with a chance to think about giving up which is a thing I had never though about before. I don’t think that giving up equals to escaping. It is that choose to not choose something in our life because we may hope to choose other things. This is kind of admiration of being ourselves.</p>

    <title>SOME RECORDS ON AMC and AIME</title>
    <url>/2021/04/14/AR%202021-04-14AMC/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>On 5th and 11th February, I finished my two AMC exams.</p>
<p>AMC is American Mathematics Competition. It is one of the most popular and welcomed maths competition all over the world. During primary school, I used to take part in AMC8 and receive a relative high score(Top 2.5%). As a result, after attending senior high school, AMC became one of my after-class activities as well, because I wanted to challenge myself through it. </p>
<p>During my process of preparation, I felt a little bit lonely from time to time, as there were only a few students in my class choosing to try AMC12 which is beyond the current syllabus.</p>
<p>I tried to talk with August who prepared for AMC12 too, about the exam preparing. We discussed questions from time to time after that. Now, we are good friends. This is the most impressive part of the activity. </p>
<p>I started to understand that although we may compete with each other during the competition, it is still important and possible for us to cooperate, as a result of friendship. Competition is more than competing. August and I received satisfied scores. I got 103.5points in AMC10A and 117points in AMC12B. </p>
<p>Additionally, through AMC, one thing has become clearer than before. The process of improving, challenging and studying may be lonely because everyone makes different decision during this period. For example, my best friend Estella chose to forgo AMC as she wanted to take part in FBLA more. Another example is that during the last preparing day, August and I still had a lot of things which we had not learnt and understood. We chose to study different areas.</p>
<p>From my point of view, the aloneness is one of the lessons we need to learn during our studying time. </p>
<p>Fortunately, I got the chance to take part in AIME(America Invitational Mathematics Examination). However, something unexpected happened. The date of AIME was conflicted with my school IGCSE mock examination. I said to myself several time, “Mock is more important as it is the first time for me to experience international examinations hold by CAIE and mock exam will be the source of GPA of this semester.” Every time the sense of not convinced also came to my heart as it really took me hours and hours learning maths knowledge and going through past papers. </p>
<p>Finally, I decided to give up preparing for AIME to save time for mock exams. After handing in my AIME paper, I got to know that this time I must have been failed to achieve anything. It was near 8 p.m. when AIME was done. Block 1912 opposite my school was still full of music sounds and colourful lights. Suddenly, one concept which I learnt in Economics came to my mind——opportunity cost and made me feel relived.</p>
<p>Everyone has limited time and energy, but I always long for finishing everything which is unattainable and impossible. As a result, it is necessary for me to make a decision on what to do. Opportunity cost is the next best choice foregone when making a decision. I still remember the words which were said by my Economics teacher Ms. Cindy when I told her that I would switch my future major from Physics to Economics. She said that, “Every decision or choice has an opportunity cost. I simply hope that you can consider the thing carefully before making a decision.”</p>
<p>Perhaps to Estella, she though FBLA was more important than AMC so she made such a decision that high prize was rewarded to her by FBLA but not so good performance was shown by her in AMC. To me, I still hope to achieve higher marks in IGCSE instead of AIME.</p>
<p>To sum up, I will always remember AMC and AIME of this year. They provides me with a chance to experience the concept of opportunity costs by myself instead of leaving it only as a piece of knowledge in my Economics books. </p>
<p>Meantime, after seeing the lights and hearing the sounds from Block 1912, I am not regretted about my decision anymore, although a total of only 4 marks was achieved by me in AIME, because I still realised that life sucks, so it may be better for me to be cute and enjoy and try to get understand the tastes of life more, instead of giving myself too much press to spend time seeing the around world.</p>

    <title>Some records on Being Teaching Assistant</title>
    <url>/2021/05/30/AR%202021-05-30TA/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>During the revision for IGCSE, my economic teacher Ms. Cindy used the way of letting students act as teaching assistants to review the knowledge. </p>
<p>I was asked to go over the three sections on Macroeconomics. This was quite surprising because the three sections on Microeconomics which has even fewer knowledge points than Macroeconomics were allocated to three students in class. At that time, sense of responsibility came to my heart suddenly.</p>
<p>After that, I started to think about what to review and how to review. From my point of view, the details of Macro are linked together with strong logic, so I chose to use mind map. It really took me a lot time to finish the whole mind map although at the same time I was busy preparing for not only IGCSE but also competitions including IEO and Euclid, and the final presentation of several subjects. </p>
<p>Everything was finished perfectly before the revision day. Ms. Cindy spent several noon discussing the details in mind map with me, so I was exactly confident. Every details was excellent and Ms. Cindy praised me a lot .</p>
<p>Afterwards, I thought about why Ms. Cindy would like to provide me with this chance to challenge myself, although she always says that I am too shy or too nervous to give public speeches behind the whole class.</p>
<p>I could not help asking her about the reason. She smiled and looked at me quietly. Several seconds later, she told me that she hoped that I could practice my speech ability through this presentation. Meanwhile, the process of giving presentation would contribute to my Economics study, as she always looked forward for me to receiving a high mark in IGCSE Economics. </p>
<p>This is not privilege. It is the nice relationship between Ms. Cindy and I that inspires her to do that. The hundreds of afternoons spent together discussing all kinds of problems will be in my memory, which help me make connection with her. My junior high school head teacher once told me that if you want to get to understand someone else or make friends, the best way is to make connection with him or her through communicating and paying attention. </p>
<p>Being teaching assistant teaches me that in order not to let down other’s expectation, it may be better for us to try our best and give a perfect result as possible as we can. Meanwhile, communicating and paying attention are the best way to build an admired relationship as both sides make efforts.</p>

    <title>Some records on IEO(International Economics Olympiad)</title>
    <url>/2021/04/29/AR%202021-04-29IEO/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I took part in International Economics Olympiad China Open Round on 11th April.</p>
<p>It was two weeks after my mock exams and three days after Euclid Mathematics Contest. Meanwhile, as the semester was near the end, most subjects final projects which had great influence on my GPA had the deadline at that week, including Economics, Business, Music and Visual Art.</p>
<p>Working to deadline is always my preference. However, after the mock exam, when going through the schedule, a reality came to me which was that the work was so much that it was almost impossible for me to deal with in just one week. I needed to make a plan ahead instead of missing deadline or finishing things curtly.</p>
<p>The plan was like that on Monday I needed to finish the outliner of Business project which would take me around 1 hour and the first part of Economics mind map which would take me about 2 hours. I thought I could finish everything perfectly and with high quality with the help of the plan. </p>
<p>However, the truth is that as it was difficult for me to estimate the time needed accurately, the plan was not completed at the first day, because Business outliner took me too much time. Every time when the time was not enough I chose to give up IEO.</p>
<p>I still understood that IEO was very important, because it is not a personal competition, but a team competition. I need to spend time preparing it as it is essential for me to be responsible to my teammate no matter whether they are responsible to me. The only thing I could do was to ask Economics teacher Ms. Grace for help. </p>
<p>I talked to Ms. Grace and asked her whether she could provide us with several office hours to go through the syllabus. She agreed. As Ms. Grace is an Economics teacher, she does not know about Business and Finance(30% of points were about Business and Finance). I hoped to read A-Level Business book to make sure I can solve the problems during the exam, but there was too much knowledge and too short time to finish. I went to my Business teacher Ms. Cindy. She provided me with a summarised book and several advices. The night before the exam, I spent about 8 hours finishing reading and understanding the book until 3 a.m.. I do not praise what I have done because enough sleeping is exactly important for us. I am still happy with is, as the result of discovering how interesting Business and Finance are and having the courage to challenging myself. </p>
<p>After finishing the exam, I knew that although I may not do IEO well and get low marks, I had tried my best and would not be guilty for not doing well. The result did not mean too much because the experiences and the feelings of challenging were more important. </p>
<p>To sum up, IEO taught me two lessons. The first one is that sometimes we maybe can not follow the plan, so it is important for us to both leave some spare time when making plan and record why we can not finish it to make sure the same thing will not happen for a second time. In addition, follow what you believe and you will find yourself improved through this process. Meanwhile, the whole universe will come to help you when you really want to achieve a thing, so you will gain more, such as the friendship between Ms. Cindy and I.</p>

    <title>Some records on HSYLC — Why HSYLC</title>
    <url>/2021/08/25/AR%202021-08-25%20Why%20HSYLC/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>HSYLC is HCAUSCR (Harvard College Association for US-China Relations) Summit for Young Leaders in China. I first heard about it from my friend Estella.</p>
<p>At first, I was thinking about whether to apply to this activity. I was worrying about the writing sample. I did not have high-quality writing sample, because most of my works are just for recording my feelings or my thoughts, instead of analysing the whole passage like formal book review. I spent some time going through all my works and finally found several self-satisfied ones. Finally, I decided to apply for it. To be honest, I did not think much at that time. Maybe because of the experience of rejecting the offer from UWC, I think more choices can provide me with a chance to meet a better world based on my personal condition.</p>
<p>I was so lucky that I was able to receive an interview invitation and a final offer.</p>
<p>By the end of July, COVID-19 broke out again in Nanjing, my city, and everything had been changed. I received the call from the organisers. They told me that I would not be able to take part HSYLC any more because of the breakout. However, several days later, they decided to have everything online. I started to think about——why HSYLC, because at the same time, I had a variety of tasks could do. </p>
<p>Why HSYLC?</p>
<p>Firstly, it is an activity which brings students all around the country together. This provides with a chance to meet more people and have a better understanding of celebration of difference which is one of my values. Because I think I am a little bit introverted and nervous, I want to develop a more confidence characteristic. If I want to achieve this, in the following semester, I can talk to my schoolfellow in IB Diploma Curriculum more. Because some of them have great confidence and can let me understand how they perform in some social events. </p>
<p>Also, I want to learn some special subjects there. For example, it provides classes about Finance and Economics. There are all kinds of lessons like Business Management, Financial Plan or Insurance and Reinsurance. However, because HSYLC is more like a social event, the knowledge I can learn is really limited. I can learn some courses on the online course websites like Coursera to achieve this aim easily.</p>
<p>Last but not least, I still want to practice the teamwork. By the end of last semester, I was a member of SALT FISH Group when taking part in WWW Project (Week Without Wall Project). Something unpleasant happened in our group and I felt extremely tired. I hope that I could have a chance to experience group work again in order to understand what is the most proper way for me to do it in the future. Maybe I can corporate with my friend Yuki to develop a website about Industrial Research. This can help me achieve teamwork and accumulate Economics experiences at the same time. </p>
<p>To sum up, it may be better for me to give up HSYLC. However, I still decided to take part in it, because I think it would be an unforgettable experience in my senior high school life.</p>

    <title>Some records on HSYLC — Spark in Science Lessons</title>
    <url>/2021/08/27/AR%202021-08-27%20HSYLC%20spark%20Science%20subjects/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I chose to learn several science related subjects during HSYLC.</p>
<p>The first one is called <em>How technology contributes to future education</em>. It briefly introduced the use of technology in our daily education. For example, some primary or secondary schools in Shanghai use AI (Artificial Intelligence) to carry on some Physics experiment. This can effectively reduce the danger of accidents happened during the real experiment. </p>
<p>The second one is called Introduction to Web Development and Programming. We learned the basic logic and simple sentence and grammar in Language HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We use them together to design a website as the final homework. </p>
<p>The programming languages, based on my understanding, are more like tools which can be used for achieving some tasks which may include writing a website or collecting and collaborating some data to work out the trend. We can definitely design a website for the students from primary school and secondary school. This website can provide them with almost all the resources during the school day. This makes it much easier for them to do some self-study at home because of the accessibility of studying materials. Also, the website should have the ability to design a simple study plan for the students. As we think low-grade students may not have understood how to plan their time well or make a SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time-scale specific) plan. However, it may still have several problems, like as we have the website for them to design plans for them, this may create disincentive for students to plan their time by themselves. They may even refuse to make a plan, because of a lack of planning skills and understanding about their personal condition.</p>
<p>I think the classes related to Education more provides me with an understanding about how to design a class or how to create incentive for students. The programming languages, including HTML, CSS and JavaScript, also Python I learnt before by myself, are skills which help me achieve my ideas in areas like eduction.</p>

    <title>Some records on HSYLC —— Sparks in Economics and Business Lessons</title>
    <url>/2021/08/29/AR%202021-08-29%20HSYLC%20spark%20Econ%20subjects/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Because I am a student who is really interested in Economics and Social Science, I chose Economics as my main major in HSYLC. As a result, several lessons are related to Economics and Business Studies. </p>
<p>For example, my concentration seminar is <em>Introduction to Insurance &amp; Reinsurance Industry, Actuarial Science and Insurance Consulting</em>. Also, I need to complete a short essay about <em>What’s the Influence of Registration System Reform on China’s Stock Market</em>?</p>
<p>When learning about Insurance and Reinsurance Industry, we spent most of our time understanding different concepts, such as, premium, first layer and so on. I still remember that during preparation of IGCSE, I made a clear definition list for all the concepts. The list helped me to go through all the definitions and have a clear understanding about what the concept exactly means. Maybe this is one way of learning Social Science subjects. Understanding different concepts in Insurance makes further calculation more easily.</p>
<p>Calculation makes me worried. It is not about I did not know how to calculate. It is more about calculation is very simple or following some steps. From my point of view, this can be replaced by computer or programs in the future. Also, when looking at the Stock Market, I found it most of the data can be collected and analysed by the computer.</p>
<p>I started to think the link between computer science and social science. It seems that nowadays most research and application in social science are more quantitive instead of qualitative. We prefer to use a huge set of data to find a general trend instead of just working out something based on the “common sense”. </p>

    <title>Some records on IPQ -- Thinking on peer pressure</title>
    <url>/2021/07/29/AR%202021-07-29%20IPQ--peer%20pressure/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>During the summer holiday, I attended some class to complete my Independent Project Qualification (IPQ). There are several students from other cities like Shanghai, Beijing or Shenzhen. We took lessons together. </p>
<p>One day, I had dinner with some students from Ulink College which is a famous A-Level school in Shanghai. They were talking about their study of A-Level. I was so surprised that, we are students of the same grades. However, they have already finished what I will study in the future two years. I was deeply influenced and felt anxious, stressed and worries. After that, I spent several hours thinking about what I can do in the future to make myself being able to compete with them. </p>
<p>My teacher Ms. Diao told me this was the result of peer pressure. </p>
<p>What is peer pressure? Wikipedia defines it as the direct influence on people by peers, or the effect on an individual who is encouraged and wants to follow their peers by changing their attitudes, values or behaviours to conform to those of the influencing group or individual. </p>
<p>To be honest, I have been suffered from peer pressure even since I was in my junior high school. At that time, I was always the second place in my class. It seemed that it was impossible for me to become the first. As a result, during the final year, the question which was whether I could become the first in class appeared in my mind everyday. After becoming a student in senior high school, I always worried about getting lower scores than my classmates or attending fewer activities than my classmates, because these will make me weaker than them when applying for universities. </p>
<p>Why I have peer pressure? This is the question coming to my mind, because I know when solving some problems, it is important for us to know the cause of the problems. </p>
<p>We are living in the society and are members of many organisations. For example, I am a member of my class. At the same time, I am a member of my family, my school, my project teams. Partners act important roles in my life. My friends in class are my partners. My parents are my partners as well. But I know that my friends and my parents are of huge difference. They are in different ages. They have different relationship with me. They provide me with and I give them different things. </p>
<p>Peers are our partners who are in similar ages with us.</p>
<p>I never worry about why I can not do the same things as my parents at present, but I used to be trapped in the problem why I could not achieve same grades in school as my parents did when they were in school. This is another kind of peer pressure. </p>
<p>As I mentioned above, we are members of many organisations. This provides us with a platform to see people who have connection with us. It is almost human-beings’ instinct to compare, because everyone wants to prove that themselves are the best. There is an old saying in China—“The beauty is loved by all”. We hope that we are the beauty because we are a member of “all” as well. </p>
<p>Peer pressure is everywhere in our daily life. We could not help us comparing with others in all aspects. </p>
<p>When looking at the consequences of peer pressure, things become more interesting. Some people say that peer pressure provides them with energy to continue working, while others think that it stops them from becoming better and better because of the heavy heart of gain and loss. </p>
<p>Actually, everyone pays attention to different things. Nichole, my best friend, worries about her emotions more, because she has been suffered from bipolar affective disorder for a long time. Yuki, my dest mate, may worry about the relationship between her boyfriend and her more. By comparison, I pay most of my attention to my study, including the grades, the activities, the achievements, the competitions and so on. This is the reason why after listening talks to the students from Ulink I became anxious and stressed.</p>
<p>I know that we are in different platform because we are students from different schools. I know that they are in Shanghai which is a more developed city than Nanjing. I know that they have been in the international system of education longer than me. However, I do hope that I can do as well as them instead of falling behind them.</p>
<p>In order to solve this problem, I talked to my junior high school Physics teacher Ms. Jiao, my senior high school Economics and Business teacher Ms. Cindy, and my counsellor Ms. Diao. They all hope me to pay less attention to others and just be myself, instead of being influenced by others. From my point of view, this is almost impossible for me. I made up my mind to develop several hobbies and separate my attention. Also, I will try my best to become better and better. </p>
<p>Ms. Diao’s parting advice to me during my birthday is very impressive, “Take it easy. Grow up slowly.”</p>

    <title>SOME RECORDS ON AMC12A</title>
    <url>/2021/11/12/AR%202021-11-12AMC/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>It was in the afternoon of 11th November. I just completed my Mid-term exams and received satisfying scores in several subjects, while some of them were not so good. It seemed that I could not have much time preparing for AMC.</p>
<p>I thought in Senior 1, I got 117 in AMC12B. As a result, it may not be very difficult for me to get a similar score in this year’s AMC12. However, when starting to go through the past papers, I found that most questions became very strange for me to solve. </p>
<p>This year, 2021, I spent most of my time studying Economics and Economics related subjects, instead of paying much attention as I did in 2022. This made my ability in Mathematics decreased a lot. Also, I started to use calculators, instead of working out the solution by hand. This cause my poor calculation ability as well. Still, compared with last year, I spent only several days preparing for it. Last year, I spent almost the whole winter holiday studying new pieces of knowledge and practising past papers. This is because my aim of taking part in had changed. Last year, I hope that I could get a high score and a satisfying prize. However, this year, I just wanted to test my mathematics ability in order to provide guideline for my future preparation for admission test like STEP or MAT or TMUA. </p>
<p>I would not be dissatisfied if I would not get a score above 100 or whatever get a prize, because I knew that I did not pay much attention to this competition. I still remember that, my junior high Mathematics teacher once told us that, “You cannot get a score which is beyond your recognition, unless depending on the fortune”. This statement is always what I tell myself when preparing for an exam and during the releasing of the grade. This is another change of me made by competitions like AMC, which is that I am able to accept the results more peacefully. </p>
<p>To sum up, this year AMC12A will not get a high score. I am sure about this. But, I am happy with the changes I made and several things I realised during this process.</p>

    <title>Some records on NEC — Leading a Club</title>
    <url>/2021/09/22/AR%202021-09-22%20NEC%20activity%20report%201%20about%20club/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Before the beginning of the new semester, Senior 3 students asked whether there were some students in our grade wanting to be the club leader of Economics Club — EconLinked Club in our school. I thought I was kind of good at and interested in Economics. As a result, I talked to them and became the Vice President of EconLinked Club.</p>
<p>One of the main functions of our club is to establish NEC teams for students and provide them with extra-curriculum lessons for NEC. We talked to Gabriel who was the coach of NEC last year. Unfortunately, he said that he would not do that again this year, because he thought this was unnecessary and a waste of time. Every year, hundreds of students in our school take part in NEC. However, only few of them are able to get a chance to go to final competition. Meanwhile, a large percentage of students did not pay attention to the lessons which means they do not listen carefully to the teacher when having NEC lessons. </p>
<p>We do not have a coach. This is the first problem we met. </p>
<p>Additionally, this year our school delays the end school time and we need to have one more lesson which is called CCA. Students are asked to take part in three different clubs every week. This means we have a chance to have lessons weekly with unchanged students name list.</p>
<p>However, there is a conflict between our problem and the chance of providing regular lessons. We do not have the ability to provide lessons for the students, but we can not find professional teachers to do this. </p>
<p>Starting and leading a club is more about having it. We need to think about how to held activities and when to held activities and for whom to held activities. </p>

    <title>Some more records on IEO(International Economics Olympiad)</title>
    <url>/2021/06/17/AR%202021-06-17IEO2/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>In the evening of 28th April, I received the result of IEO.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, our team pass Open Round and get the chance to take part in China Final Round. Meanwhile, I personally got First Prize.</p>
<p>As soon as I got the result, I sent messages to Ms. Cindy who helped me a lot prepare Business and Finance part in IEO. She said, ‘God! Congratulations!’ Then, I told her that I really thanked her as she provided me with both help with learning Business knowledge and the incentive to continue doing instead of giving up. She said, ‘Sylvia, it is mainly you. Please come back with a grand prize in the final round!’</p>
<p>While being inspired by Ms. Cindy’s words, one of my teammate told me that he may not be able to take part in Final Round because of the time conflict with another competition. I was kind of upset and hoped that miracle would happen, but it didn’t happen. </p>
<p>This makes me rethink about responsibility. To prepare for the examination, I stayed up late and got up early to make sure that I would not hinder my teammates. However, when the result came out, the truth is that I get the highest points, although all my teammates got higher marks than me in a previous competition. However, I still reflected myself.</p>
<p>What is responsibility after all? It is the willingness and ability to respect the others and makes sure that you finish your duty fully. Maybe deciding to form a team with my current team is an action which is not responsible to myself as I didn’t talk to them about my aim before making the decision. Still, I didn’t ask my teachers for suggestion although we are from different classes and know little about each other. </p>
<p>To sum up, IEOC provides me with a chance to think about the responsibility again. I started to understand that the most important thing is to be responsible to myself and the to others. After this, all the teamwork may be completed successfully and happily. </p>

    <title>Some thinking on preparing NEC</title>
    <url>/2021/12/02/AR%202021-12-02%20NEC/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>This is the second year for me to take part in the National Economics Challenge. Many things have changed and improved. I have learn a lot during this process as well.</p>
<p>Last year, I made up a team with my classmates Yuki, Tiffany and Leo. Although we are all fond of Economics, we still did not act as a tear to prepare for this competition. Yuki and I read the Principle of Economics written by Gregory Mankiw and watched several videos provided by Khan Academy. The result was not satisfying.</p>
<p>This year, I made up a team with Yuki again, but we chose to collaborate with two students from IB program in our school. The process was not easy, because at the beginning, we made team with two students outside our international centre. One of them is from the main campus, while the other is from Jinling High School International Centre. However, our school teacher Mr. Gabriel talked to me after the releasing of IGCSE results. He said that we could not make up team with students outside the centre, or he would not provide us with any academic help. </p>
<p>Finally, Yuki and I decided to make a team with Silvia and Redd from IB program.</p>
<p>Silvia is a good leader. The experience and feeling of following her really teach me a lesson. After our first meeting, which even did not happen last year, she came up with a plan immediately. I was surprised by her high productivity and high efficiency. Also, she was so self-consistent. Then, she sent us a lot of notes collected by her last year when preparing for NEC. All of them were detailed and clearly labelled.</p>
<p>After attending such a team, I started to write notes when reading Principle of Economics instead of writing commends as I did before. Also, I learnt that a good leader needed quality like time management and planning detailed which I did not have. As I am the class monitor and class representative of Business Studies, these learnings and thinkings can all contribute to my work. </p>
<p>To sum up, NEC is more than an Economics competition to me now, as I start to be a member of a team. What is the most important is that this is a good team with a good leader and good members. </p>

    <title>A personal goal I have set for myself</title>
    <url>/2021/04/30/PS%202021-04-30%20Personal%20goals/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Junior High School had many challenges but the main one was the high amount of arguments that I had. There arguments caused a variety of problems such as losing several friends.</p>
<p>After graduation, I hoped to have matured and become less argumentative, but his goal was extremely hard to achieve, because I did not take any action such as trying to be calmer until I met Ms. Cindy, my senior high school Economics teacher. Being the class representative provided me with a lot of chances to communicate with her. We talked about all kinds of topics, including our class, the school, the subjects and even our families. During this process, I discovered that although she is a person who has many perspectives on small details, she seldom can’t help expressing the perspectives. She rarely becomes argumentative. After that, I started to pay attention to my temper and set a goal which was to be as non-confrontational and mild-mannered as Ms. Cindy.</p>
<p>To reach this goal over a period of six months I have had to try various strategies. I firstly searched the Internet. Most people said it would be very useful to read more books. Additionally, I asked Ms. Cindy for help and her advice was to consistently reflect on the discussion after quarrels and try my best to be patient and calm during communication. Meanwhile, I could come to her after quarrels to tell her the reasons and she would provide me with rational analysis.</p>
<p>After several more quarrels and rational reflection with analysis, it was not hard for me to feel that I have started to become more tolerant. It is easier for me to be tolerant with others and my attitude is improving.</p>
<p>Through this process, I have found that it is not too difficult for me to change myself if I am really thirsty for the this. It encourages me to set more goals and objectives to improve myself in order to become a better person or the person which is more ideal in my mind.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>My name is Yiran Dai. Others call me Sylvia. I am a student in Grade 10 at Nanjing Foreign Languages School International Curriculum Center.</p>
<p>I have spent 15 years living in Nanjing, which is my hometown. I have always longed to see the wide world outside Nanjing, so I have travelled gone to other places all over the world. For example, I visited the U.K. in 2017 with my friends. I can’t forget the beautiful views of the Thames. In addition, I enjoy playing the piano and the violin. Photography and reading interest me as well. </p>
<p>My family consists of my parents, two cats and me. My cats are fond of playing with me. Sometimes, I feed homeless cats in my school and community. My family regard me as an outgoing and kind girl.</p>
<p>I have a wide circle of friends. I organize activities and events for my class and school, such as the New Year Gala in my school. When we are stuck for fresh ideas, new ones come to me very quickly. When we face difficult problems, I help to come up with a solution quickly. They call me “the most creative female in the world”. When I asked my close friends why they had made friends with me, almost everyone told me that it was because I have a strong sense of ceremony. I remember their birthdays, anniversaries and important events and send messages to them. Additionally, I built friendships with my Physics and Economics teachers. They always praise me for my accurate self-assessment and efforts made in each subject.</p>
<p>I am really proud of myself in two respects. Firstly, as I mentioned above, I am capable of organising large events. I am happy to act as a leader. Secondly, although I am always in a hurry every day, I spare some time to listen patiently to others and to talk to them.</p>
<p>This is me, a girl who is both thoughtful and sensitive.</p>

    <title>An event sparked a period of personal growth</title>
    <url>/2021/07/03/PS%202021-07-03%20Personal%20growth/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>During the preparation of IGCSE exams, my economics teacher, Ms. Cindy, asked students to act as teaching assistants to revise the subject.</p>
<p>I was given the sub-topic of Macroeconomics which is about the whole economy instead simple industry. Even though we all had other study tasks to do, I decided to spend a lot of time preparing and researching because I realised it would be an important exercise for me given my weakness in giving talks. However, many other students put in little effort. </p>
<p>Long time after the presentation, I started to think about why Ms. Cindy wanted to provide me with this chance to challenge myself in the role of a teaching assistant, although she always said that I was too shy and nervous to give talks in front of the whole class. However, I don’t think this was her aim and could not help asking her for the reason. She smiled and looked at me quietly. She told me to recall my feeling in the exam room. I said I did not have any specific feelings, but the exam went smoothly. She said, ‘Last week, Yuki, who is responsible for presentation on Microeconomics, came to me. She was upset because she felt apprehensive during the exam and regretted giving up preparing for the presentation.’ I understood. This was exactly an opportunity for us to go over all the details because it became evident that it was important to prepare and research because this lead to deeper understanding. </p>
<p>since then, I take every task, such as presentations, designing posters and many other school tasks seriously no matter whether it influences my grades or not, because it will help me improve in the long run. </p>
<p>Personal growth, such as learning better organisational and interpersonal skills, can happen during small event which can be a presentation or a conversation with others. The skills I have learnt from the experience will be important for my future studies and help me to grow as a person. </p>

    <title>Thinking on 25 Things You Need to Know About the Future</title>
    <url>/2020/12/16/RR%202020-12-16%2025%20things%20you%20need%20to%20know%20about%20the%20future/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I was inspired by a book called <strong>25</strong> <strong>things you need to know about the future</strong> written by Christopher Barnatt to discuss several details about the future development. </p>
<p>According to the two part I have read, the author holds the opinion that the new technology can help us save and reuse resources in the future and the aim is to reduce loss of energy during production. However, from my point of view, I don’t deny the author’s opinion, but we may need to pay more attention to sustainable development, like reusing resources as much as possible, clean energy like hydrogen energy and less pollution caused during production and daily life. Reducing loss may be not useful in long run as the total resource we owning is invariable, unless we achieve to use the resource as efficiently as over a large proportion. By contrast, reusing resources can consider the resource we owning is unlimited because we can always reuse them if they are used in correct ways. In addition, clean energy and less pollution supplement each other. Clean energy can reduce the cost of cleaning pollution and the waste caused during coal-based production. </p>
<p>As Hegel says, ‘but what experience and history teach is this – that nations and governments have never learned anything from history or acted upon any lessons they might have drawn from it.’ He means people can never go into a same river. Because we are at different time and meeting different problems, it is hard for us to follow the lessons which the history taught us. Both the author and I are analysing the trends of development. No one can judge who is correct or who is wrong through the history. The only thing we can do is to leave the right to judge to time.</p>
<p>The third part of the book has a meaningful name which can be regarded as a paronomasia. </p>
<p>The name is <strong>Fuelling the Third Millennium</strong>. The first layer of meaning is to analyse new resources or new ways to transforming energy in the following years to play the role of fuel, just like the oil in the past two millennium, while the second is to give some support to help and encourage the third millennium become better and better.</p>
<p>This part made me to think about a question — why do people create new things? Or I can explain it as what makes people to keep working instead of remaining unchanged? I think the answer is that people always desire something new to make the life much better and easier or some bad situations drive people to change. These two conditions differ from each other apparently. The first situation is to act spontaneously, consciously and initiatively. Compared with the first one, the second one is acting passively. From my point of view, the first situation is better than the second one, as the people realise themselves and own a heart of getting stronger. </p>
<p>Sometimes, some problems appear and then we take action. This is also kind of acting passively. However, if we can converse the way which we consider the world from being asked or forced to do something into acting spontaneously to improve ourselves and make a little contribution to the whole world to complete our own value of life, the result will not as bad as acting passively. Some changes will happen. </p>
<p>During the process of developing, situations discussed above will happen, but not limited to this. We may fail, just as the author wrote in the book, for example several rockets exploded. The loss of people’s lives and equipments can not be ignored. Anyway, the failure has been caused. The only thing we can do is to learn something from the failure and consider why we failed and how to be better next time. This is the thing that all the scientists who are trying to develop new ways to conserve the energy are doing now. They learn from the experience from the elderly and use the knowledge to do more experiments. They may fail as the elderly. They keep trying instead of giving up easily.</p>
<p>The last two parts of the books talk about two topics. One is computer science and inorganic life, while the other is future medicine. Although the author highly praised and held high expectation in these two fields, I still think these two topics can both be regarded as Pandora’s Box. </p>
<p>I never doubt that the computer science and medicine can play a positive, irreplaceable and essential role in human beings’ development. By contrast, I am worrying whether we have abilities to control the intelligent creatures designed and created by us. I read a short science fiction novel <strong>t**</strong>he** <strong>Bookshop at the End of the Universe</strong> written by Jiang Bo. The novel tells a story that after hundreds of years, humans can learn knowledge by technology instead of studying and reading books. Everyone is almost under the computers’ control as we can not think and study. This is kind of horrible and unacceptable. However, the significance of science fiction novel is to predict one result of development.</p>
<p>After considering the result of development, moral philosophy should also be discussed. Can we regard robots as humans, if they can think independently? Can we regard the knowledge which we get in other ways instead of learning by ourselves as the knowledge we own? Should people live an infinite lifespan? Everything is beyond the knowledge we have at present. It still requires a long time to complete the system of moral philosophy. In my opinion, things in the future, even tomorrow, are uncertain. As a result, these two parts of the book can be looked upon as discussion about whether we are ready to develop new technology. This comes back to the first part we discussed about this book above and makes a logic circle which might be intricate nowadays. </p>
<p>I really like this book, although the author and I have different opinions in several point. Additionally, it still is definitely shocked that some predictions in the books have become reality. The author predicted that a kind of virus would spread all over the world someday. This came true in 2020 as everyone knows that COVID-19 spread almost every corner on the Earth.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I have finished read this small book which predicts future. In some ways, I think this book is more likely to be a prediction on future technology, than future. Many points in the book make sense. We can only see a small part of the development of AI, Internet, biotechnology, nanotechnology and quantum physics. There is still a long way for us to go to discover how to put these things into use.</p>
<p>Today, many people merely consider their own benefit instead of owning the awareness of developing together. The society is not equal. The wealth you have may be able to decide how long you can live and how fast your wealth will grow. Gaps between people will become larger and larger, as a result, the competition will be more and more drastic. From my point of view, the solution is hidden in social science.</p>
<p>Future is about technology, but is more than it. It is more about the human beings and the society, including humanitarian things and a variety of meaningful things needed to be considered by us. </p>

    <title>Thinking on One Two Three…Infinite</title>
    <url>/2021/01/26/RR%202021-01-26Thinking%20on%20One%20Two%20Three%E2%80%A6Infinite%20/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>What is infinity? In wikipedia, infinity represents something that is boundless or endless, or else something that is larger than any real or natural number. </p>
<p>To be honest, I don’t understand every detail in the book. Although this book was written about a half century ago, some knowledge is not the most famous at the moment. However, this book is still not out of date actually. </p>
<p>To begin with counting, or maybe how to count, the author describes the ways which the ancient people followed to count. Meantime, he introduces some examples of enormous numbers. At last, he tells us several interesting definitions, like prime number and imaginary number, and famous theorem, like Fermat’s last theorem. </p>
<p>In the second chapter, the author introduces the four-dimensional space. This part becomes more difficult for me to understand as I have a poor ability of imagining. However, some interesting things attracted my attention. The four colour theorem reminds me of the geography lesson which I had during junior high school. That is the first time for me to get to know something about Topology. </p>
<p>The most unforgettable thing in the first two parts is an annotation given by the translator. The annotation is given during the author describe the four colour theorem. It says “This theorem has been proved during 1970s by the computer.” </p>
<p>What does this mean?</p>
<p>We all know that science has been developed rapidly in the past century. More and more theorems help people extend the science research. It becomes more difficult for non-professional people to learn, although in modern society, more convenient ways have been designed to learn new knowledge. Online reading is a good example. It is worth noting that, in these years, the things which have been develop do not only include science and technology, but also the ability of people to learn. This may be another thing the author want to tell us. That is the ability of people to learn is infinity as well. Humans have great potential energy to develop further in all the fields.</p>

    <title>Thinking on TAKING SIDES--Economic Issues</title>
    <url>/2021/05/01/RR%202021-05-23%20%E7%AB%8B%E5%9C%BACase1/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h3 id="ISSUE-1-Are-Profits-the-Only-Business-of-Business"><a href="#ISSUE-1-Are-Profits-the-Only-Business-of-Business" class="headerlink" title="ISSUE 1 Are Profits the Only Business of Business?"></a>ISSUE 1 Are Profits the Only Business of Business?</h3><h4 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h4><p>This issue mainly concentrates in discussing whether the only responsibility of business is to make profits.</p>
<p>I have learnt about the basic economic problem in Economics. It is that humans have unlimited wants but the resources which we own are limited in supply, so it is not possible for us to satisfy every wants. This creates the scarcity. Scarcity pushes people to make choices. The process of making choices is answering the three fundamental questions. There are mainly two types of pure market model which are market economy and planned economy. In a market economy, the consumers are the decision maker. They use their demand, after all the price mechanism, to make the decisions. In a planned economy, the decision maker is the government. </p>
<p>We all know that the aims of each economic agents are different.</p>
<p>In Ms. Cindy’s class, once we learnt about the objectives of businesses, including profit-maximisation and other aims like survival, larger market share and social welfare. I still remember at that time some students in my class could not understand why the businesses set objectives other than profit-maximisation. From my point of view, this has more things to do with the thought of the owner or enterprise of the business. </p>
<p>Most government aim is to improve the living standard of the citizens. This is the aim of every citizens as well. </p>
<p>To sum up, the main conflict of this issue is that whether the business is just a business or it holds some of the responsibility to take the role of the other economic agents in the society.  </p>
<h4 id="YES"><a href="#YES" class="headerlink" title="YES"></a>YES</h4><h4 id="NO"><a href="#NO" class="headerlink" title="NO"></a>NO</h4><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>Friedman think the people who argue for social responsiblity do not understand the role of the corporate executive in modern society. The executives are responsible to the corporate owners. If they do social responsibility and reduce the return, they are spending the money of the owners’.</p>
<p>Almeder things that defense of the immoral behavior imposes great costs on society. Federal oand state legislation must continue to impose regulateions upon businesses until businesses begin to regulate themselves. </p>

    <title>Thinking after Postgraduate Program Study — Gap</title>
    <url>/2021/12/02/RR%202021-12-02%20Postgraduate%20study%20readings/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I still remembered when I went through the websites of the programs of undergraduate, I was surprised by the complicated design of the modules. These days, I just finished reading the 10 programs of postgraduate from three top schools in the UK including University of Cambridge, University of Oxford and London School of Economics and Political Science. I found there was a gap between the application of undergraduate and postgraduate.</p>
<p>I am a student who plans to take an Economics related major. The most interesting point for Economics related major is that most of them are looking for students with strong abilities in Econometrics. The universities point this directly. However, in the part of undergraduate application, they just mentioned the strength in mathematics, instead of giving the abilities related to Economics. This shows the difference between Senior High education and University education. Senior High provides students with a chance to explore their interest and makes it possible to look more into the areas they like, while University asks the students concentrate in one area and become specialised in some fields. After all, no matter what stage, they all look for students who are good at Mathematics, and even some abilities like programming in order to analyse the data. </p>
<p>At the same time, most schools pay more attention to distinguish the theoretical and empirical areas. There are differences between the two areas. However, I still do not understand it. From my point of view, this is one of the knowledge or skills we need to obtain during University.</p>
<p>Last but not the least, critical thinking is important and specially mentioned on the website, especially LSE. Many programmes hope that students can work out both the advantages of some models and methods for analysing. Meantime, they still want students to talk about the limitations of these things. Surprisingly, some of the modules, such as Macroeconomics, discuss the limitations of the government policies.</p>
<p>To sum up, the most obvious gap between undergraduate and postgraduate is the way of thinking and analysing knowledge and cases.</p>

    <title>Thinking on Tengnuo</title>
    <url>/2022/01/30/RR%202022-01-30%20%E5%A4%A7%E5%9B%BD%E7%9A%84%E8%85%BE%E6%8C%AA/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Some thinking on <em>Changing Position of a Great Country</em></p>
<p>It is a book written by Fan He which is the professor majored in Economics and Management. He has researched the government policies and measures, and the market for tens of years. This is the fourth book in his series which aims at recording 30 years of the economic development of China.</p>
<p>This book is talking about the changing position called <em>Tengnuo</em> in Chinese which is recognised as the future solution of all kinds of problems especially during the competition. </p>
<p><strong>What is *tengnuo*?</strong> </p>
<p>It is about when facing problems, we can change our way of thinking and generate another method to contribute to a positive result. When I first got this concept, I thought this is some how similar to the sayings told by my Chinese teacher in junior high school. It is quoted from a song which has the lyrics of “These is a crack in everything, that’s how the light gets in”. He also said, “Please remember to find the positive point when you face serious problems and even make some mistakes.” </p>
<p>However, after thinking twice, I found some differences between them. My teacher aims at the mental position of us which means we need to think more positively and provide ourselves with some satisfying words. However, tengnuo is the following step after thinking which is the action. It tells us to take future action.</p>
<p>Firstly, we need to find a breaking point because the competition is never carried out in one dimension. As a result, concentrating all the advantaged resources in one point can provide us with chance to compete with the competitors. Additionally, it is also important to pay more attention to ourselves instead of being influenced by others. Finally, the condition which limits us should be changed. The time, for example, can be used to balance problems. We do not need to solve all the problems in a specific time. By contrast, it will be more proper to make the time more elastic and find new opportunities.</p>
<p><strong><em>Tengnuo\</em> and country</strong></p>
<p>Nowadays, China is facing thousands of problems, such as the ageing population, the lack of people in rural areas and the announcement of a variety of policies. </p>
<p>We can employ tengnuo to solve these problems. For example, the ageing population which is always seen as the problem or the drawback of the whole society. However, if we concentrate in researching and developing new products specially designed for the elderly. This is kind of tengnuo, because we are generating the risks into opportunities instead of complaining it all the time, doing nothing and being afraid of it. </p>
<p><strong><em>Tengnuo\</em> and my life</strong></p>
<p>This is a significant part of controlling and directing an organisation. When studying the Human Resource Management in Business Studies, we learnt about the method of creating motivation of the employees. I started to understand that the basics of motivating employees. With the help of the concept tengnuo, I can understand it better now. Many HRs use the method of increasing the salary or wages of the employees. However, thousand of the psychologists and economists spent time learning non-financial factors such as the Scientific Management Method by Taylor, Expectation Theory by Vroom and Hierarchy of Human Need by Herzberg. This is a kind of tengnuo, as these scientists found that the money sometimes could not incentive the employees. Thus they started to pay attention to other aspects.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Tengnuo will always be one of the most useful methods during problem solving because this is another way of thinking and analysing for both the individuals and the whole economy.</p>

    <title>Thinking on Economics Through Everyday Life Chapter1 What is economics &amp; Why does it matter?</title>
    <url>/2022/02/01/RR%202022-02-01%20Economics%20through%20everyday%20life%20Chapter1/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h1 id="Extract"><a href="#Extract" class="headerlink" title="Extract"></a>Extract</h1><h2 id="PartA-Economics-Defined"><a href="#PartA-Economics-Defined" class="headerlink" title="PartA Economics Defined"></a>PartA Economics Defined</h2><ul>
<li>What do economists do? A simple answer is that economists practice, teach, or work to advance the field of economics.</li>
<li>Every person who chooses finance or accounting as a college major is also required to duty economics, but economics isn’t the same as finance or accounting. Economics is the framework that underlies all the business disciplines, just as physics is the framework that underlies all the engineering disciplines.</li>
<li>What interests an economist is how human beings behave when they get their hands on a pile of money. In other words, economics is about human behaviour.</li>
<li>We might say that economics is the social science concerned with how people (or other decision-making units such as business firms or government agencies) can best allocate their limited resources to achieve optimal or maximum satisfaction. Or, we could say that economics deals with how people make choices in conditions of scarcity.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="PartB-Economic-Resources"><a href="#PartB-Economic-Resources" class="headerlink" title="PartB Economic Resources"></a>PartB Economic Resources</h2><ul>
<li>Most modern economists start from the assumption that having more material goods is better than having fewer material goods. Thus the more-is-better paradigm is fundamental to economics, although it is sometimes questioned and even criticised.</li>
<li>Economic resources are generally divided into four categories: land, labour, capital, and entrepreneurship.<ul>
<li>Land includes any natural asset that may be used in producing goods and services.</li>
<li>Labour is exactly workers along with their skills and abilities. The resource category of labour also has a connection with the term human capital, which refers to workers’ skills, experience, and education.</li>
<li>Capital includes all goods produced in support of the production of other goods.</li>
<li>Entrepreneurs assemble material resources and determine reduction and distribution. They are innovators who dream up new products, create new twists to old products, and open new markets for established products. They also assume the risk of failure inherent in any business endeavour.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When the stock of resources increases, or when the quality of resources improves, the result is economics growth.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="PartC-Schools-and-Subfields-of-Economics"><a href="#PartC-Schools-and-Subfields-of-Economics" class="headerlink" title="PartC Schools and Subfields of Economics"></a>PartC Schools and Subfields of Economics</h2><ul>
<li>No one is coordinating all this activity. It is all occurring as if it were being guided by an unseen power. This power is what Adam Smith called the market’s “invisible hand,” and what modern economists recognise as market forces.</li>
<li>Major schools of economics thought<ul>
<li>Classical school<ul>
<li>The economy operates best when markets are mostly left to their own devices — when the government employs a liaises-faire, or hands-off, approach.</li>
<li>Prices (also known as the price mechanism) allocate resource efficiently, as if all economic activity were being guided by an invisible hand.</li>
<li>Advocate free trade, specialisation, and the division of labour.</li>
<li>There was little or no role for the government in managing the economy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Marxist school<ul>
<li>Capital is will one day be replaced by socialism and then, later on, by communism.</li>
<li>Labour theory of value — It states that the value of a good derives from the labour required to produce it.</li>
<li>Marxists favour the notion of tightly controlled markets or no markets at all.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Neoclassical school<ul>
<li>Built on the proposition of Classical economics and began to focus on some of the finer details of interactions in markets.</li>
<li>The neoclassical view begins with the assumption that people are basically rational when they make decisions.</li>
<li>Neoclassicals believe that consumers behave rationally and attempt to maximise their utility, or satisfaction, within the limits of their available resources. Sellers, also assumed to be acting rationally, are seen as attempting to maximise their profits.</li>
<li>The focus on comparing additional costs and additional benefits, or marginal analysis are emerged from the Neoclassical school.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Keynesian school<ul>
<li>He agreed with a number of basic tenets of Classical economics. But he also disagreed with certain Classical ideas such as the notion that unemployment is self-correcting, or the belief that government has no significant role to play in correcting the economic problems of a nation, state, or region.</li>
<li>Keynes and his disciples believed that government has the means, as well as the moral obligation to counteract problems such as unemployment and inflation through its taxing and spending policies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Austrian school<ul>
<li>The Austrian school of economic thought is related to the Neoclassical school and sometimes even seen as a subcomponent of that school.</li>
<li>As believers in and defenders of free markets, the Austrians are vehemently opposed to government involvement in the economy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New institutional school<ul>
<li>The New Institutional school of economic thought is another extension of Neoclassical economics.</li>
<li>One important idea that emerged from New Institutional economics in the concept of transaction costs, or the extra costs involved in the completion of a transaction. These include the costs associated with searching for products, negotiating terms, and enforcing agreements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Monetarist school<ul>
<li>Monetarism is another school of economic thought that argues for free markets.</li>
<li>It maintains that, in the short term, the economy’s output, or gross domestic product (GDP) is primarily determined by the money supply, or the total amount of money in circulation. Over the longer periods (or what economist typically refer to as “the long run”) the key determinant of the current-dollar GDP is the overall prices in the economy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Behaviouralist school<ul>
<li>Behavioural economics, broadly speaking, borrows certain concepts and ideas from psychology and overlaps to some degree with that field.</li>
<li>Through carefully designed laboratory experiments and other forms of research, behavioural economists have identified situations in which people are systematically irrational.</li>
<li>Behavioural economics includes several different strands such as psychological economics, experimental economics, and behavioural finance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Personal-thinkings"><a href="#Personal-thinkings" class="headerlink" title="Personal thinkings"></a>Personal thinkings</h1><p>This chapter mainly focuses on the most basic concepts in Economics, such as the factors of production and scarcity. Additionally, it introduces some major schools of economics thought including behaviouralist school, monetarist school, new institutional school, Austrian school, Keynesian school, Neoclassical school, Marxist school, and Classical school.</p>
<p>When I was reading the part for classification of schools, it was surprising that many of them occur in both IGCSE and A-Level textbooks without being mentioned the type of school. For example, I have never learnt it before that it was Neoclassical economists who argued that customers behaved rationally during purchasing. During the process of introducing all these major school, I started to understand that Economics is never only being black or white which means if we can explain it with our own words or with the support of data, we can say that our conclusion makes sense.</p>
<p>However, generating this understanding is much more difficult than just knowing it from the aspect of ration. When reading the Marxist school, I found it hard for me to criticise its sayings. </p>
<p>There is one sentence in the chapter which I really appreciate and love, saying, “Even Nobel laureates in economics sharply disagree with one another. That’s one reason why you, as an informed citizen, should have a basic understanding of what’s at stake in those disagreements, so that you can listen to both sides and arrive at your own conclusions.” The values of UWC (United World College) include “celebration of different”. From my point of view, this can be applied in the study and research of Economics as well.</p>

    <title>Thinking on The Fuzzy and The Techie</title>
    <url>/2021/02/14/RR%202021-02-14Thinking%20on%20The%20Fuzzy%20and%20The%20Techie/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>This book mainly talks about the relationship between the Liberal Arts and digital world.</p>
<p>What is the Liberal Arts? Liberal arts generally covers four areas including the natural sciences, social sciences, arts and humanities. At present, there are some liberal arts colleges in the U.S.A. which are undergraduate institutions of high education, for example the Wellesley College. From my point of view, liberal arts plays an essential role in our society. First of all, liberal arts can also be described as “psychology”. All the liberal arts majors aim to research the way in which humans consider things and the influence on the society caused by these consideration. From example, Economics is the study which looks for the mentality of the consumers, producers and governments in a specific market. In addition, liberal arts also represents interdisciplinary study and research. A liberal arts education encourages students to integrates different areas of study, making students to explore a variety of subjects. This results in students can consider one problem from multiple perspectives.</p>
<p>What is STEM? STEM stands for science, technology, engineering and maths. These subjects promote the development of technology which has a wider meaning than the technology in STEM. This will result in a better living standard. For example, it is possible for us to print a house in a relative short time with a 3D printer which requires a long time with plenty of workers to finish.</p>
<p>I must point out that STEM and liberal arts coincide in some areas. For example, they both cover the natural science which include chemistry, physics and other subjects. </p>
<p>The first thing I want to talk about is the interdisciplinary studies. This is defined as the combination of two or more academic disciplines into one activity. When it happens, something is created by thinking across boundaries between different subjects. At present, a variety of interdisciplinary studies appears in our society for example the PPE ( Politics, Philosophy and Economics) and HSPS (Human, Social, and Political Sciences). During interdisciplinary studies, students can easily develop the skills of critical thinking, communication, creative problem solving, self-expression, innovative research and lifelong learning. This can promote the digital worlds as when we start an Internet company, everything needs to be considered detailedly without any mistakes. These skills will work. The study of liberal arts is mainly the interdisciplinary studies. To sum up, from the aspect of the interdisciplinary studies and the skills, the liberal arts is able to promote digital world.</p>
<p>The nest thing drawing my attention is the replacement by the technology. In the book, the author describes the situation in which the some workers are replaced by the technology, for example, the proportion of farmers has decreased a lot during the past century in America because of the development of automation. I still remembered the words which were said by my junior high school head teacher Mr. Cao. He said that in the future, we needed to concentrate in one areas to be more professional, because this could help us avoid being replaced by others. With the development of technology, the main problem has turned from replacement by the other workers to replacement by the technology. The times changed. Our competitor has changed from people to machines. I don’t mean that we need to reject all the technology. The most important thing is how to balance the relationship between technology and workers. From my point of view, overuse of technology may result in an increase in unemployment. Unskilled people may find it more and more difficult to earn a living. Skilled people must be more and more professional to keep their job. However, liberal arts can solve this problem in some ways. If everyone takes liberal arts, they will learn to think independently and critically. This results in that everyone has clear direction of self-development. Digital world can progress better in such social environment.</p>
<p>The last thing is people oriented. Why is liberal arts important? Except the reasons mentioned above, another vital reason is that liberal arts is kind of human based. In modern society, the technology can work out a variety of solutions of a problem, but it is difficult for them to choose, because the choices are made with consideration for a lot of factors, not only the costs and opportunity costs, as our society is made up of over seven billion people. A company which has workers can not survive without people oriented. After a long-time squeeze, people may do some crazy things. Everything will change, if the company is people oriented, Google discovered that if bosses greeted workers enthusiastically in the morning, the productivity would show an increase. </p>
<p>In conclusion, the liberal arts plays a positive role in the Digital World. However, I think liberal arts can influence all the fields optimistically because of its features. </p>

    <title>Thinking on Economics Through Everyday Life Chapter2 Thinking like an economist</title>
    <url>/2022/02/02/RR%202022-02-02%20Economics%20through%20everyday%20life%20Chapter2/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h1 id="Extract"><a href="#Extract" class="headerlink" title="Extract"></a>Extract</h1><ul>
<li>Some economic thinking coincides with what many people call “common sense”. But other theories, principles, and findings fro the field of economics strike the average person as counterintuitive.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="PartA-Fundamental-Economic-Concepts"><a href="#PartA-Fundamental-Economic-Concepts" class="headerlink" title="PartA Fundamental Economic Concepts"></a>PartA Fundamental Economic Concepts</h2><ul>
<li>Incentives<ul>
<li>Although the idea that incentives matter may seem obvious, a lot of smart people are unclear on the concept. But actions have consequences.</li>
<li>Rules and operating procedures are a necessary component of responsible governing. But government policymakers and business managers who are thinking about implementing a new measure should make sure you’ve considered the potential changes in incentive structures. If they fail to think the issue through, they’ll learn about the unintended consequences the hard way.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Opportunity costs<ul>
<li>This concept separates the economists from the accountants.</li>
<li>A situation may present more than two options, of course; in fact, there may be thousands of options from which to choose. But in any situation where only one option can be chosen, the forfeited value of the best option that is not chosen is the costs of that choice — its opportunity cost.</li>
<li>Opportunity costs aren’t always easy to quantify.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cost-benefit analysis<ul>
<li>Economists are experts in assigning monetary value to things that don’t ordinarily have dollar signs attached to them.</li>
<li>As the term implies, cost-benefit analysis involves comparing the cost of a given action with the benefit (value) of that action.</li>
<li>Economists have also developed a number of methods for assigning dollar values to forests, rivers, clean air, and the like.</li>
<li>An economist will also consider the forest’s no use value, which is the value it holds for people who will never use the first for any activity or harvest its trees for any purpose.</li>
<li>As we consume more and more units of a particular good over a given period of time, the benefit, or utility, we derive from that good tends to fall with each successive unit that we consume. This is the principle of diminishing marginal utility.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sunk costs<ul>
<li>Economic theory suggests that if a sunk cost you’ve already incurred constitutes one element of a decision that you’re facing, you should ignore the sunk cost and focus instead on the costs and benefits you’ll face as you go forward. Your attention should be on your future marginal costs and marginal benefits, not on your sunk costs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rational behaviour and types of preferences<ul>
<li>Assuming rational behaviour means that an economist will see people as generally making choices that will produce the most benefit to themselves.</li>
<li>There’s often a gap between what people say they like (stated preferences) and the preferences they express when forced to make a real choice (revealed preferences).</li>
<li>When someone’s choices reflect the order of his conscious preferences, someone is exhibiting transitive preferences, which are assumed to underlie rational decision making.</li>
<li>Incidentally, economist have conducted experiments showing that children are much less likely than adults to exhibit transitive preferences; for this reason, children are not always rational in their decision making and may need help from adults.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Purposeful behaviour, bounded rationality, behavioural economics, and biases<ul>
<li>Our process was rational within certain limits, and an economist would see it as an example of bounded rationality.</li>
<li>One particular sub field of economics, behavioural economics, has she Ishtar on situations in which people are, so to speak, predictably irrational.</li>
<li>Behavioural economics also has a lot to say about certain tendencies that affect decision making and are known collectively as cognitive biases.<ul>
<li>Gambler’s fallacy</li>
<li>Confirmation bias — People have a tendency to seek out information that they already agree with. We know what we want, we know what we like, and confirmation bias sends us out into the world, physically or virtually, in search of exactly those things.</li>
<li>Anchoring effect — It comes up in many decision-making contexts where people exhibit a tendency to lock on to the first piece of information they receive.</li>
<li>Status quo bias — It is the tendency to preserve the current state of affairs.</li>
<li>Endowment effect — The human tendency to stick with the status quo is the power behind the bias known as the endowment effect. People under the influence of this cognitive bias place more value n goods if they happen to own them than they would if they didn’t own those goods.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="PartB-Fundamental-Economic-Models-and-Assumptions"><a href="#PartB-Fundamental-Economic-Models-and-Assumptions" class="headerlink" title="PartB Fundamental Economic Models and Assumptions"></a>PartB Fundamental Economic Models and Assumptions</h2><ul>
<li>A model, of course, is a small-scale version of something bigger.</li>
<li>An economist’s model of the economy and its various aspects is a small-scale version that can’t hope to capture everything going on in the actual economy.</li>
<li>Many (though not all) economic forecasting models assume that future events are more or less predictable based on event that have already occurred.</li>
<li>Economic forecasting models are still useful, however, even though unforeseen events can and sometimes do prove their basic assumptions false.</li>
<li>Every economic model has to start from some type of assumption. A given model may incorporate its own particular set of assumptions, but some assumptions tend to be common to a variety of economic models.</li>
<li>Every economic model starts with at least some kind of generalisation.</li>
<li>Another assumption commonly used in economic models is that of coteries paribus, which is Latin for “all other things being equal.”</li>
<li>Wherever you come down on the question of nudges from the government, you have to acknowledge that government has learned its tactics from the experts — the many businesses that use advertising to nudge their customers into buying more of their products.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Personal-thinkings"><a href="#Personal-thinkings" class="headerlink" title="Personal thinkings"></a>Personal thinkings</h1><p>Economics does influence people’s way of analysing problems and events in our daily life.</p>
<p>I still remember that, by the end of Senior 1, when choosing the subjects for the future two years, I employed the concept “opportunity costs” which is introduced in this chapter. I knew that if I had not learnt Economics, I would not have been thinking in such a way. This is the treasure of Economics similar with mentioned in the chapter “Although you may not be thinking totally like an economist by the end of the chapter, you’ll hopefully gain some understanding about why economists see the would the way they do and why that’s actually a good thing.”</p>
<p>Another interesting point of Economics is that it is the study of human behaviour. However, it is also based on a huge quantity of assumptions including but not limited to, ceteris paribus, and generalisation. No one, neither all the human being group, can be simplified using a simple model with the help of several assumption. But the economists did achieve to simplify several aspects. This is kind of conflict. We can not know whether these research results are correct because none of the correctness of these can be tested. The only thing we can do is to explain them with our personal understanding.</p>
<p>Still, when I was just a little kid, I started to believe that the happiness of a person or the satisfaction can not be quantified, but economists achieved it again.</p>
<p>To sum up, Economics brings me exactly a new way of thinking and a new way of understanding the world. When choosing the subjects as I mentioned above, once I said, “Choosing subjects is not about the subject itself, but more about choosing a way of understanding the world. It is possible for me to get high marks in Business or Chemistry. However, my final choice will always be Business because I really prefer the way which is provided by Business.”</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<h3 id="ISSUE-1-Should-the-compensation-of-executives-be-subject-to-government-regulations"><a href="#ISSUE-1-Should-the-compensation-of-executives-be-subject-to-government-regulations" class="headerlink" title="ISSUE 1 Should the compensation of executives be subject to government regulations?"></a>ISSUE 1 Should the compensation of executives be subject to government regulations?</h3><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>It is common that a worker’s compensation may reflect that worker’s marginal revenue product which is defined as the additional revenues or reduced costs generated by the employment of an additional worker. The higher the productivity, the greater should be his or her earnings. </p>
<p>However, there are some other determinants of earning, known as abstract notions of worth and value. </p>
<p>I still remember that last semester when we did a business project which aimed at analysing a company, we were asked to analyse their unethical behaviours. Starbucks which is my choice does have many unethical behaviours, including low wages in plantation and tax avoidance. Also, it has the problem of excessive directors’ pay. Why the CAIE Business regards excessive pay as an unethical behaviour? This is mainly because the directors may not produce as much value as their pay to the whole company. If they do not, they are exactly taking other workers’ pay maybe the employers in office even the workers at the production line. Meanwhile, they may do tax avoidance in order to keep higher percentage of their earnings, this is not only unethical but also illegal. </p>
<p>As a result, the key problem may be whether the directors are exactly making enough benefits to the company which is worth rewarding as much high earnings as they receive or just receive high wages without achieving that. </p>
<p>When looking at the government, there is no doubt that free labour market without regulations from the government is a good condition. However, market failure may appear. On the other hand, if government sets a wage ceiling for directors, this may create disincentive for them to increase their productivity. </p>
<p>To sum up, there are probably two conflicts in this issue, including the discussion about whether it is proper for them to receive high wages and the discussion about whether the advantages of government regulation overweigh disadvantages.</p>
<p><strong>YES</strong></p>
<p>Our financial system is making fail as it created risks, does not create financial products which would help ordinary Americans face the important risks that you confronted, and mismanaging capital using high transaction costs. Also, These problems lead the economy to brink of ruin.</p>
<p>However, it is very sad that the pay was not connected with social returns or even long-run profitability of the sector. If they do connect, it is appropriate. Also, in financial system, both individual and institutional incentives were misaligned compared with other market economies. </p>
<p>Incentives which play important role in the market economy is discussed. They took the easier route which is increasing risks compared with outperforming the market in order to receive higher returns. It was this excessive risk taking that help helped bring capitalism to the brink. Meanwhile, there is a problem caused by incentive which is people pay more attention to the quantity instead of quality due to quantity-based payment. </p>
<p>Flawed incentives affect incentives to innovate. A better alignment of private rewards and social returns and better regulations including regulations that affect incentive structures holds out the prospect of better innovations. </p>
<p><strong>NO</strong></p>
<p>Compensation structures have been responsible for excessive risk taking in the financial services industry. It showed that many companies paid high bonus to their employers after receiving Federal bailout funds. The compensation constraints currently on TARP recipients will likely destroy these organisations unless they can quickly repay the government and avoid the constraints. Regulating compensation in financial services will cripple one of USA most important and historically most productive industries. </p>
<p>Given the penalties for poor performance inherent in both cash and equity incentive plans, there is nothing inherent in the current structure of compensation in financial service firms that lead to obvious incentives to take excessive risks. If the government is very clear that there is no “Too Big to Fail” guarantee, there is no need for government oversight. </p>
<p>Except for the Bonus culture, inappropriate performance measurement can lead to risk taking. In order to solve this problem, companies may pay people to write “good loans” and penalise them for writing “bad loans”. However, the challenge is identifying a good loan without waiting up to 30 years. </p>
<p>Problem of compensation in financial services can be improved. Introducing and enforcing bonus bans or “clawback” provisions for recovery of rewards if and when there is future revision of critical indicators on which the rewards were based or received is one of the solutions. Also ensuring that bonuses are based on value creation is another one. However, government rules and regulations may not make a contribution to it. For example, Golden Parachute and Section 280(G) had opposite influence on the financial services compared with its original designed plan. </p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Joseph believed that financial crisis represented the failure of the financial system to perform two of its key roles, including managing risk and allocating capital. Also, he thought that it was hard to identify significant social benefits and easy to identify large social costs associated with some of the recent financial innovations. As mentioned above, the incentive structures misallocated the capital including the human capital. For example, some of American’s most talented young succumbed to the lure of easy money.</p>
<p>Kevin believes that there is little empirical evidence to support the charge that compensation systems led to excessive risk taking in the financial services industry. Also, it is easy to say that loan officers should be paid for making good loans and penalised for making bad loans, but proposed regulations go in the wrong direction by acquiring pay “ be based solely on objective measures of performance”. Meanwhile, it is highly unlikely that compensation practices can be improved through increased government rules and regulations. </p>

    <url>/2022/02/05/RR%202022-02-05%20Economics%20through%20everyday%20life%20Chapter5/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h1 id="Extract"><a href="#Extract" class="headerlink" title="Extract"></a>Extract</h1><h2 id="PartA-What-is-globalisation-and-What-is-good-about-it"><a href="#PartA-What-is-globalisation-and-What-is-good-about-it" class="headerlink" title="PartA What is globalisation, and What is good about it?"></a>PartA What is globalisation, and What is good about it?</h2><ul>
<li>Globalisation is the process by which markets become integrated among nations. Aspects of globalisation include international trade, foreign investment, and labour migration.</li>
<li>One reason why people engaged in international trade in centuries past was that hey wanted goods that weren’t available in their homelands.</li>
<li>The primary reason why countries continue to exchange goods and services is that they stand to gain a lot from specialisation and trade.</li>
<li>Globalisation and the concept of advantage<ul>
<li>Absolute advantage<ul>
<li>In economics, a country is said to have an absolute advantage in producing a particular good if it can do so at a lower absolute cost, or per-unit cost, than a trading partner can.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Comparative advantage<ul>
<li>David Ricardo, a British economist who lived in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, introduced the principle of comparative advantage.</li>
<li>A country has a comparative advantage in producing a particular good when that country can product the good at a lower opportunity cost than a trading partner can.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A particular country may not have an absolute advantage in reducing any one good, but every country has a comparative advantage over potential trading partners in producing some good.</li>
<li>Without international trade many of the goods we purchase on a regular basis would be more expensive. Free international trade has proven so beneficial that the majority of nations in the world have entered into free trade agreements with other nations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Globalisation and multinational corporations<ul>
<li>Another important aspect of globalisation has been the spread of the multinational corporation, which is a firm that operates and owns assets in more than one country.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Globalisation and currency valuations<ul>
<li>The foreign exchange market is where the currencies of the various nations are traded.</li>
<li>There was a time when most of the world’s currencies were pegged to gold. Later, for a period of time after World War II, the United States pegged the dollar to gold, and most other countries pegged their currencies to dollar.</li>
<li>Nowadays, sot currency values float freely, which means that their value is constantly changing in relation to other currencies.</li>
<li>Trade barriers<ul>
<li>Tariff is a tax that an importer has on imported goods.</li>
<li>Import quotas are limits on the amount of a good that can be imported.</li>
<li>Voluntary export restraints (VERs) are similar to import quotas with respect to their economic impart, but they’re not exactly imposed by the importing country.</li>
<li>Quality restrictions are restrictions based on the quality of goods to be imported.</li>
<li>Government subsidies to the domestic producers of a good.</li>
<li>An embargo, typically imposed for political reasons and not for the purpose of protecting domestic firms and industries, is a complete ban on trade with a particular nation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="PartB-Free-trade-agreements-and-other-forms-of-economic-integration"><a href="#PartB-Free-trade-agreements-and-other-forms-of-economic-integration" class="headerlink" title="PartB Free trade agreements and other forms of economic integration"></a>PartB Free trade agreements and other forms of economic integration</h2><ul>
<li>A free trade agreement is an arrangement among two or more nations to form what’s known as a free trade area.<ul>
<li>The participating countries agree to reduce or eliminate tariffs and other trade barriers on the goods that they trade among themselves while keeping trade barriers in place with countries that aren’t parties to the agreement.</li>
<li>Example: Latin American Integration Association, South Pacific Regional Trade and Economic Cooperation Agreement, and North American Free Trade Agreement<ul>
<li>Customer unions are like free trade agreements, but the participating countries also agree to adopt a common external tariff.</li>
<li>Common markets feature even greater integration as well as free movement of capital and labour across international borders.</li>
<li>Economic unions include all the integration involved in common markets in addition to unity where certain economic policies are concerned.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="PartC-Protectionism-the-flip-side-of-free-trade"><a href="#PartC-Protectionism-the-flip-side-of-free-trade" class="headerlink" title="PartC Protectionism: the flip side of free trade"></a>PartC Protectionism: the flip side of free trade</h2><ul>
<li>Sometimes free trade is restricted for geopolitical reasons. One country may choose not to trade with another because the two nations are political enemies.</li>
<li>Some trade barriers exist because a country wants to preserve a certain aspect of its cultural identity, which mean that it doesn’t want foreign products — and, by extension, foreign culture — to overtake its own culture.</li>
<li>Most trade barriers are erected because of political pressure from domestic producers who want to lessen competition from foreign producers.<ul>
<li>Infant industries</li>
<li>national defence</li>
<li>Retaliation</li>
<li>Employment rate</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="PartD-Possible-downsides-of-globalisation"><a href="#PartD-Possible-downsides-of-globalisation" class="headerlink" title="PartD Possible downsides of globalisation"></a>PartD Possible downsides of globalisation</h2><ul>
<li>As we’ve seen, when trade opens up across borders, there are bound to be winners and losers in the domestic economy. But as economic theory suggest, and as most economists agree, the total benefit for the domestic economy is likely to be greater than the total cost.</li>
<li>Promotion of income inequality<ul>
<li>Economic theory suggest that international trade should have an equalising effect on income over time, but empirical studies have produced mixed results.</li>
<li>It seems likely that the question of whether globalisation promotes economic equality or inequality will depend on the countries doing the trading and on the sorts of goods they are trading.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Corporate tax evasion<ul>
<li>Capital, whether financial capital or physical capital, tends to move to where it will bring the highest returns, and lower taxes generally imply higher returns.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Abuse of weaker nations by more powerful nations<ul>
<li>When abuses do occurs, they do so under the guise of regular international trade. But, just as trade barriers are not the best way to deal with forced labour and other abuses of human rights, it’s better to establish policies that target specific abuses of weaker nations by stronger ones, rather than attempting to tackle such abuse though broad protectionist policies that oppose globalisation as a whole.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Homogenisation of national cultures<ul>
<li>The fear that local cultures will dissipate or disappear is not unfounded, but it ha to be balanced against the benefits that societies gain from the cultural cross-pollination that has accompanies globalisation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="PartE-The-economics-of-immigration"><a href="#PartE-The-economics-of-immigration" class="headerlink" title="PartE The economics of immigration"></a>PartE The economics of immigration</h2><ul>
<li>Immigration does not appear to harm the economy, and in some ways it actually helps it.</li>
<li>In addition to boosting economic output and employment, immigration also helps the economy in another important way. Our native-born labour force has been shrinking — and will continue to shrink — relative to the number of retirees receiving Social Security benefits.</li>
<li>The economic benefits of globalisation are too great and will continue to be vast. There’s no doubt that as communication and transportation continue to become cheaper and faster, and as the cultures of the world continue to blend together, the world will just keep growing smaller and smaller.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Personal-thinking"><a href="#Personal-thinking" class="headerlink" title="Personal thinking"></a>Personal thinking</h1><p>I still remember that for the first time to learn about the international trade and the concept of absolute and comparative advantages, I found it difficult to understand why most countries follow comparative advantages instead of absolute advantage. After reading this chapter, some of the doubts have been solved. However, new questions come to my mind.</p>
<p>We all know that globalisation generates great benefits to the nations, especially when countries all specialise in the production which they have comparative advantages. However, why some countries still impose protectionism. I know that maybe the national defence and infant industry can be problems, but based on the theory of utility, they can not maximise the utility. As a result, is the government rational when making such decisions and announcing these policies? </p>
<p>These questions are hard to be solved because the actual utility can hardly be measured quantitively using the money as the unit. It is mentioned previously that the work of economist is to quantify these quantities, so I believe that these questions can be solved in the future or maybe have been solved but I don’t know that.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<h1 id="Extract"><a href="#Extract" class="headerlink" title="Extract"></a>Extract</h1><h2 id="PartA-The-miracle-of-markets"><a href="#PartA-The-miracle-of-markets" class="headerlink" title="PartA The miracle of markets"></a>PartA The miracle of markets</h2><ul>
<li>You could say that markets are one of humanity’s most amazing inventions — but that wouldn’t be quite accurate. A free market is truly amazing, and yet it’s not exactly an invention. It is simply a form of human interaction, a means for people to experts their tastes, have their wants and needs met, and earn their livelihoods by serving their fellow human beings.</li>
<li>A market is an institution or medium that connects potential buyers with potential sellers.</li>
<li>Demand is simply the consumer’s need or desire for a good or a service.</li>
<li>This basic notion — that people tend to want more of a good at a lower price and less of the good at a higher price — is embodied in a fundamental principle in economics known as the law of demand.</li>
<li>The law of supply says that when the price of a good rises, sellers are willing to provide greater quantities of the good, and that when the price falls, sellers are willing to provide less of the good.</li>
<li>Demand and supply gravitate toward a point, called the equilibrium, where the quantity of a good that sellers are willing to provide is the same as the quantity of the good that consumers want to purchase.</li>
<li>Each time there’s a change in the forces that underlie demand or supply, the market responds and a new equilibrium is reached. No individual or centralised agency coordinates any of this activity, and no one needs to. It occurs naturally as an outgrowth of human interaction.</li>

<li>Markets are amazing and beautiful when they work well, and in most instances, they work very well indeed. When they don’t, we have what economists refer to as market failure, a situation in which a market, left to its own devices, produces either more or less than the socially optimal amount of a good or a service.</li>
<li>Causes of market failure — Most commonly because of poor or incomplete information, lack of competition, or the presence of external costs or benefits.<ul>
<li>Poor or incomplete information<ul>
<li>Typically in such a case, one party to a transaction will have more information than the other party. In a situation like this one, economists say there is asymmetric information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lack of competition<ul>
<li>The outcome is not socially optimal in these scenarios, because the market fails to attract potential consumers who would be willing to buy the product or service if it were competitively priced.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>External costs and benefits — Positive and negative externalities<ul>
<li>A particular type of market failure has to do with what is called a public good. The key characteristic of a public good is that it can’t easily be divided, and so people can’t easily be prevented from enjoying its benefits.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The need for regulation</li>
<li>Market failure versus failure of market outcomes<ul>
<li>Nothing reveals human tastes as well as markets do; you can ask people what they like, but you won’t get nearly as honest an answer as when you observe that they’re actually buying.</li>
<li>Markets are completely nonjudgmental. They have no morality built into them. That’s one reason why a government may decide to regulate a market: the market’s activity doesn’t conform to acceptable social standards.</li>
<li>An important thing to keep in mind, however, is that social standards and notions of morality and ethics can tend to change over time.</li>

<li>A price ceiling is a maximum price allowed by law, and a price floor is a minimum price required by law.</li>
<li>Price ceilings<ul>
<li>When a price ceiling has been established, sellers are not allowed to charge more for a particular good than the price set by the government. The problem with price ceilings is that they change the incentives in a market.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Price floors<ul>
<li>When a price floor is in effect, the government requires sellers to charge buyers a specified minimum amount for a good or service. Like a price ceiling, a price floor changes incentives in ways that distort the market. As experience shows, a price floor may come with other unintended consequences.</li>
<li>The minimum wage</li>
<li>The living wage</li>
<li>Agricultural price supports</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="PartD-Government-failure"><a href="#PartD-Government-failure" class="headerlink" title="PartD Government failure"></a>PartD Government failure</h2><ul>
<li>If a market failure occurs, the government’s intervention may be justified. But it’s also true that the government doesn’t always offer the best solution. Politicians and bureaucrats may end up making things worse or even creating a whole new problem — a situation known as government failure.</li>
<li>There’s no one-size-fits-all approach to determining when there’s an economic basis for government intervention in a failed market, so it’s wise for officials to examine the costs and benefits of sitting the failure out, versus intervening to solve the problem.</li>
<li>Of course, estimating the costs and benefits of proposed regulation is complicated, time-consuming, and potentially controversial task — exactly the kind of task that will keep economists employed in this country for a long time to come.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Personal-thinking"><a href="#Personal-thinking" class="headerlink" title="Personal thinking"></a>Personal thinking</h1><p>Most of the things in this chapter have been taught in IGCSE or A-Level Economics. </p>
<p>This is an important part in Microeconomics including the demand and supply, the equilibrium price, market failure which I think can be regarded as the drawbacks of market economy, and government failure which I think can be regarded as the drawbacks of the planned economy or the government intervention.</p>
<p>Comparing the free market and the market with government intervention, they share a similar characteristic which is suffering from possible problems which means no matter which market it is, it is always probable for the society does not enjoy the society optimal</p>

    <url>/2022/02/04/RR%202022-02-04%20Economics%20throught%20everyday%20life%20Chapter4/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h1 id="Extract"><a href="#Extract" class="headerlink" title="Extract"></a>Extract</h1><h2 id="PartA-Competitive-versus-non-competitive-markets"><a href="#PartA-Competitive-versus-non-competitive-markets" class="headerlink" title="PartA Competitive versus non competitive markets"></a>PartA Competitive versus non competitive markets</h2><ul>
<li>A market or industry characterised by perfect competition has so many sellers of a good or s</li>
<li>The products in a perfectly competition environment market, and even ini a market that is highly if not perfectly competitive, tend to be standardised.</li>
<li>If a firm is the only seller of a particular good or service, the firm is said to have a pure monopoly on that good or service.</li>
<li>A market can also be an oligopoly, one that consists of a few large firms or is dominated by a few large firms.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="PartB-Monopolies"><a href="#PartB-Monopolies" class="headerlink" title="PartB Monopolies"></a>PartB Monopolies</h2><ul>
<li>One barrier to entry is when it’s most efficient for a single firm to supply an entire market. In this situation, the firm is said to have a natural monopoly.</li>
<li>Another type of barrier is a resource monopoly, with a single firm controlling all access to a necessary input.</li>
<li>Common misconceptions about monopolies<ul>
<li>One misconception is that monopoly firms are guaranteed high profits.<ul>
<li>It’s true, of course, that if a company has a market monopolised, the company stands to earn a much higher profit than it would if the market were competitive.</li>
<li>It’s also possible for a company to have a monopoly on a product or service for which there isn’t enough demand to generate a profit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Another misconception is that a monopolist necessarily charges the very highest possible price for its product or service.<ul>
<li>Because this monopoly firm wants to maximise its profit, it can’t charge the highest price that a tiny minority of its customers would be willing to pay. If it did, it would lose the vast majority of the market. The firm’s customers would simply find other alternatives.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>One of the biggest misconceptions about monopolies is that they’re always bad.<ul>
<li>But the fact is that many monopolies create extraordinary value, not just for stockholders, managers, and employees, but for society as a whole.</li>
<li>Besides, some products might never have become available at all if their inventors and developers hadn’t been granted patents and monopoly power for long enough to recoup the costs of research and development.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Identifying monopolies<ul>
<li>There are measures that economists can use to determine how competitive an industry is. The two principle measures are concentration ratios and the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index(HHI).</li>
<li>“Four-firm concentration ratio”<ul>
<li>When the ‘four-firm concentration ratio’ of an industry is calculated, the result shows the market share of the four largest firms in an industry as a proportion of the industry’s total sales.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>HHI<ul>
<li>The HHI’s potential values may be as low as nearly zero (for a very highly competitive industry) and as high as 10000 (for an industry whose market is limited to one seller, a purely monopolistic scenario).</li>
<li>If a proposed merger is a highly concentrated market seemed likely to increase the HHI by more than 200 points, then the merger might face government opposition on the grounds that it would unduly decrease competition if allowed to proceed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We’ve seen that every firm in an oligopolistic market is extremely sensitive to the effects of the actions taken by the other firms in that market.</li>
<li>A group of businesses engaged in collusion is commonly referred to as a cartel.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Monopolistic competitions<ul>
<li>The monopolistic competition does enjoy a monopoly, but only when it comes to its own brand; in contrast to the pure monopolist, and there are close substitutes for the monopolistic competitor’s product.</li>
<li>A monopolistic competitor’s goal is to convince consumers that there really are no close substitutes for its product, even though that’s actually not the case.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="PartC-Antitrust-regulation-and-enforcement"><a href="#PartC-Antitrust-regulation-and-enforcement" class="headerlink" title="PartC Antitrust regulation and enforcement"></a>PartC Antitrust regulation and enforcement</h2><ul>
<li>The government has long sought both to regulate firms that have monopoly power and, at times, to restrict the formation of monopolies in the first place.</li>
<li>The economic justification for regulating a monopoly is that monopolistic practices tend to create higher prices and lower levels of output than would exist in a competitive market, and such outcomes aren’t socially optimal.</li>
<li>Review of mergers and acquisitions<ul>
<li>One of the primary ways for the government to limit the formation of monopolies is to review proposed mergers and not allow some of them to go through.</li>
<li>Merger cases can become very political.</li>
<li>The fact that some administrations have allowed mergers that probably would have failed under other administrations implies that a certain amount of discretion exists in the enforcement of antitrust laws.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Price-based antitrust regulation<ul>
<li>The government may choose to regulate a monopoly firm by imposing a price ceiling with the aim of achieving a market price close or equal to the price that would prevail in a competitive market.</li>
<li>In a highly concentrated market, however, it’s hard to get a price ceiling right because they must gauge what the competitive price would be in a market that has never been truly competitive.</li>
<li>Government regulators may also prevent a dominant firm from engaging in certain kinds of anticompetitive behaviour such as predatory pricing, or the practice of setting a very low price, often below the cost of producing a good, so as to har a competitor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Breakup of monopolies</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Personal-thinking"><a href="#Personal-thinking" class="headerlink" title="Personal thinking"></a>Personal thinking</h1><p>At the beginning of this chapter, the author discussed several forms of market structures and then mentioned the misconception of monopoly, followed by a variety of forms of antitrust actions. Before reading this, I have never learn the antitrust acts so detailedly and structurally. </p>
<p>Some of the people in our world believe that the monopoly is bad or even evil. However, in fact, these monopolies do play important roles in the market and generate benefits to the whole society. We never deny that monopoly power brings problems such as a low degree of competition, a relatively high price, fewer choices, and the over reliance on certain companies. It is kind of critical thinking that it both has positive impacts and negative outcomes.</p>
<p>However, although there are great positive impacts creating by the monopolies, the governments all around the world are still trying to imposing regulations and laws to prevent some actions and even reduce the existence of monopoly. This is because the economists, the governments, the monopolistic companies, the customers and other stakeholders holds different views, all of who argue for their benefits or the benefits of the most people. This is acceptable after all.</p>

    <title>Thinking on Economics Through Everyday Life Chapter9 The future of economics</title>
    <url>/2022/02/09/RR%202022-02-09%20Economics%20through%20everyday%20life%20Chapter9/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h1 id="Extract"><a href="#Extract" class="headerlink" title="Extract"></a>Extract</h1><h2 id="PartA-An-involving-science"><a href="#PartA-An-involving-science" class="headerlink" title="PartA An involving science"></a>PartA An involving science</h2><ul>
<li>Economics, like other social sciences, is a field that is always changing. Economists have been applying more and more computing power to their models, and even within the past few decades the methods and results of economic analysis have improved dramatically.</li>
<li>As computing resources become more and more powerful, and as data sets become larger and more comprehensive, economists will be able to do many more kinds of analyses.</li>
<li>Another development that is already occurring in economics is the movement toward multidisciplinary research. At one time, research economists worked alone or perhaps with one or two colleagues who were also economists, but now it’s much more common to see economists working with researchers in psychobiology, sociology, law, ecology, and other fields.</li>
<li>Ceasing to perceive scarcity would require a wholesale reprogramming of human attitudes, a shift that also seems unlikely, at least in our lifetimes.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Personal-thinking"><a href="#Personal-thinking" class="headerlink" title="Personal thinking"></a>Personal thinking</h1><p>My counsellor told me once that coding ability would be important and it would be better if I spent some time learning Python if I wanted to major in Economics in the future. At that time, basically, I agree with her, but I really don’t think that Python is as essential as she said.</p>
<p>The future development of Economics is still not certain, maybe in Behavioural Economics or any other fields, but it seems that the certain one is the researching method which is quantitative with the help of programming.</p>
<p>I have never dream of solving scarcity in the world. It is extremely impressive that, in my first Economics lesson, my Economics teacher at that time, Ms. Cindy, told us that people’s needs and want could never be satisfied because they were unlimited. I used to be a student who wanted to major in Physics. At that time, I learned from Physics aspect, if we wanted to achieve an unlimited resource, the final solution might be the invention of perpetual motion machine with the help of superconductivity. You see, Physics and Economics can be connected and intermediated by this.</p>

    <title>Thinking on Economics Through Everyday Life Chapter6 Understanding the macroeconomic news</title>
    <url>/2022/02/06/RR%202022-02-06%20Economics%20through%20everyday%20life%20Chapter6/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h1 id="Extract"><a href="#Extract" class="headerlink" title="Extract"></a>Extract</h1><h2 id="PartA-Macroeconomics-and-Microeconomics"><a href="#PartA-Macroeconomics-and-Microeconomics" class="headerlink" title="PartA Macroeconomics and Microeconomics"></a>PartA Macroeconomics and Microeconomics</h2><ul>
<li>When economists talk about macroeconomics or the macroeconomy, they’re referring to the economy as a whole or to the economy’s larger sectors. These latter include the public sector and the private sector, which in turn is sometimes subdivided into the business sector and the private sector.</li>
<li>When economists talk about microeconomics or the macroeconomy, they’re referring to specific industries or to individual decision-making units, such as consumers, firms, or government agencies.</li>
<li>It’s not always easy to draw the line between macroeconomic and microeconomic issues.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="PartB-Indicators-of-economic-health"><a href="#PartB-Indicators-of-economic-health" class="headerlink" title="PartB Indicators of economic health"></a>PartB Indicators of economic health</h2><ul>
<li>Rate of economic growth<ul>
<li>Gross Domestic Product (GDP)<ul>
<li>GDP can be thought of as the total spending in the economy on domestically produced goods and services.</li>
<li>Whereas GDP focuses on where production is taking place, GNP (Gross National Product) focuses on the citizenship of the people who are the owners of the factors involved in production.</li>
<li>When the national income accountants at the Bureau of Economic Analysis calculate the rate of economic growth, they have to be careful to use real GDP rather than nominal GDP in their calculation.</li>
<li>Real GDP is adjusted for inflation — or, to put it more broadly, real GDP is adjusted for changes in the nation’s price levels.</li>
<li>GDP divided by the population is known as per capita GDP, and it’s an especially handy measure for comparing the economy of one nation to that of another.</li>
<li>Arguments against using GDP as a measure of the nation’s economic health<ul>
<li>GDP accounts only for output, not for the input required to generate than output</li>
<li>GDP includes economic activity surrounding many negative events</li>
<li>GDP includes activity that involves human pain and suffering apparat from the effects of natural disasters or social unrest</li>
<li>GDP doesn’t account for the value of nonmarket labour</li>
<li>GDP doesn’t account for changes in the quality of products</li>
<li>GDP is not a good measure of a nation’s level of well-being and happiness</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Leading Economic Index<ul>
<li>A complete discussion of all the economic indicators in use would take up an entire book, but one of them, the Conference Board’s Leading Economics Index (LEI) deserves mention because it includes a lot of valuable underlying information and can be useful in predicting economic upturns and downturns.</li>
<li>The 10 key variables that the LEI tracks tend to reveal coming trends earlier than the variables that other economic indicators are watching.</li>
<li>On average, the LEI does a better job of predicting future economic conditions than any of its 10 underlying variables does on its own.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Almighty Dow<ul>
<li>The Dow Jones Industrial Average, commonly referred to simply as the Dow, is a widely reported stock market index that was created in 1896 by Charles Dow, a Wall Street Journal editor and cofounder of Dow Jones &amp; Company.</li>
<li>The Dow tracks the price movements of the stocks of 30 large, publicly traded US operations. It’s not a straight-up average of stock prices, but when the stock prices of the 30 companies rise on average, the Dow also rises.</li>
<li>The Dow is intended to give investors and market watchers an overview of market conditions and trends, but it’s not without its critics, of course. Some people contend that, given the roughly 10000 publicly traded companies in the country, the Dow uses too small a sample to provide an accurate reading of market trends.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Unemployment rate<ul>
<li>It’s a true measure of well-being and provides some indication about what’s really happening on the ground.</li>
<li>The unemployment rate is different for people of different racial and ethnic groups, age groups, education levels, and employment types.</li>
<li>Bear in mind when you run across the unemployment rate in the press that it’s a national average, and so it may not reflect what’s happening with employment in the area where you live.</li>
<li>Also remember that the unemployment rate, because of the shortcomings in how it’s calculated, may not capture the true amount of labour underutilisation that’s occurring in your town or in the nation as a whole.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rate of inflation<ul>
<li>Inflation is a sustained rise in a nation’s overall price level for goods and services.</li>
<li>Inflation can become a serious problem in any economy<ul>
<li>Inflation harms people who live on fixed incomes, such as income form a pension that doesn’t include a cost-of-living adjustment</li>
<li>Inflation penalises savers whose methods of investment aren’t indexed to inflation</li>
<li>Inflation harms lenders who haven’t accurately factored inflation into the loans they’ve granted</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the real threat of inflation is that, left unchecked, it can get out of hand and lead to a rapidly accelerating inflation spiral known as hyperinflation. When hyperinflation occurs in a country, the monetary system typically breaks down.</li>
<li>Measurement of inflation<ul>
<li>The inflation rate is calculated as the rate of change in a price index, which represents an average of prices for multitudes of goods and services in an economy.<ul>
<li>Consumer price index (CPI)</li>
<li>Producer price index (PPI)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If prices can go up, can they come down?<ul>
<li>A drop in overall prices is known as inflation</li>
<li>Typically, prices fall because demand for goods and services is also falling. When goods begin piling up in warehouses, sellers have no choice but to lower prices to move the merchandise.</li>
<li>Deflation can also complicate things in a shrinking economy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Interest rate<ul>
<li>Interest is the charge paid to a bank or other lends for borrowed money — usually a certain percentage of the amount borrowed. In other words, the interest rate is the price of money.</li>
<li>There are many different types of interest rates in the economy.<ul>
<li>Prime leading rate, which is the interest rate that banks charge their most creditworthy customers</li>
<li>Federal funds rate, which is the interest rate that US banks pay each other for overnight loans</li>
</ul>

<li>Monetary policy, fiscal policy, and the federal reserve<ul>
<li>Monetary and fiscal policy<ul>
<li>Monetary policy is the set of actions taken by a central bank to regulate the size and growth of a nation’s money supply.</li>
<li>In the United States, the federal government plays a role in managing the economy and influencing the macroeconomy thought its fiscal policy. The government tools of fiscal policy come down to two basic elements: taxes and expenditures.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Federal reserve<ul>
<li>In the United States, the central bank is known as the Federal Reserve, and it’s often referred to as “the Fed”.</li>
<li>The history and structure of the Federal Reserve<ul>
<li>The Federal Reserve structure represents a compromise between those who wanted a strong central bank and those who feared its development.</li>
<li>One aspect of the compromise is that the bank wasn’t set up as one large institution but rather as 12 main Federal Reserve banks distributed throughout the country.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Fed and monetary policy<ul>
<li>One of the Fed’s jobs is to manage the nation’s monetary policy.</li>
<li>The Federal Reserve has three basic tools of monetary policy at its disposal. In other words, it has three different approaches available for managing the money supply<ul>
<li>Discount rate<ul>
<li>Since the Fed acts as a bankers’ bank, it offers loans to banks in need of reserves. The interest rate that the agency charges on such loans is know as the discount rate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Required reserve ratio<ul>
<li>All banks are required to keep a portion of their outstanding deposits in reserve, and banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System keep some of those reserves on hand at the Fed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Open market operations</li>
<li>The Fed engages in open market operations — that is, the Fed buys and sells government securities on the open market, such as US Treasury bonds and other instruments that the government uses to finance its operations.</li>

</ul>
<h1 id="Personal-thinking"><a href="#Personal-thinking" class="headerlink" title="Personal thinking"></a>Personal thinking</h1><p>This chapter mentions about the macroeconomic concepts such as GDP, price indices and interest rate. The way of introducing such concepts differs from that of the textbooks of IGCSE and A-Level.</p>
<p>This book introduces the measures of economic health which is the same between the two sets of books. However, the following parts, introducing about the monetary and fiscal policies, are really diverse. This book uses USA Federal Reserve as an example and discusses the measures qualitatively, while our textbooks simply says the several policies together with the supply-side ones and then use graphs and numerical method to describe.</p>
<p>Both qualitative and quantitative analysis methods are acceptable, but from my point of view, I prefer use quantitative one more because it provides us with the extent to which the policy may be effective and useful, while qualitative ones may only says the changes instead of giving us a possibility to compare the forecast and the reality.</p>

    <title>IPQ - Conclusion &amp; Others</title>
    <url>/2021/08/30/WORKS%202021-08-30%20IPQ%20Conclusion&amp;Others/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>\</em>Conclusion**</strong> </p>
<p>To sum up, this report analysed the current situation of United Airlines and provided suggestions for future development by using SPACE Matrix Analysis. We found that the whole industry suffered from the pandemic of COVID-19, although it is recovering slowly. United Airlines, the third-largest airline company in the world, is in challenging condition. In 2020, its profitability was negative, shown by the income statement. The cash flow statement was not optimistic, as it shows that United Airlines’ net income and net cash provided by operating activities decreased. Luckily, the balance sheet is improved because some indicators considered by the investors, like the total assets and stockholders’ equity, are all in advantaged situations. The future development is analysed using SPACE Matrix Analysis. We found that United Airlines may take defensive actions to survive during the pandemic of COVID-19. </p>
<p>There are several limitations in the present study. The main limitation is a lack of data while using the SPACE Matrix. For example, price elasticity of demand, the indicator of environmental stability, will be more accurate with the help of a questionnaire. However, because this is hard to carry out, we can only estimate it. Another limitation is that all the points are given by us subjectively. We do not have a scale to refer to.</p>

    <title>Thinking on Economics Through Everyday Life Chapter8 The social security system, welfare spending, &amp; healthcare in the United States</title>
    <url>/2022/02/08/RR%202022-02-08%20Economics%20through%20everyday%20life%20Chapter8/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h1 id="Extract"><a href="#Extract" class="headerlink" title="Extract"></a>Extract</h1><h2 id="PartA-Social-security-A-ticking-time-bomb"><a href="#PartA-Social-security-A-ticking-time-bomb" class="headerlink" title="PartA Social security: A ticking time bomb?"></a>PartA Social security: A ticking time bomb?</h2><ul>
<li>Some people are convinced that the US Social Security program is doomed and that the whole thing will blow apart at some point in the next few decades. Others are more optimistic about the program’s future.</li>
<li>Calling the program a time bomb is on the extreme side, but it’s true that Society Security needs some adjustments to remain solvent for future generations.</li>
<li>The Social Security program wasn’t originally intended to provide a retiree’s sole source of income, and that’s still true today. The original program looked different from today’s, as many changes have been made to it over the years.</li>
<li>In theory, the Social Security Trust Fund exists, but the fund is really more of an accounting trick than a true pension fund, and it is projected to run out by 2034. Other portions of the Social Security system, such as disability insurance, are projected to be out of money much sooner.</li>
<li>The systems basic problem, and the reason why it won’t work as well in the future as it did in the past, is demographics.</li>
<li>The myth of the Social Security Trust Fund<ul>
<li>Most people already understand that the Social Security benefits paid to current recipients are funded by current workers’ payroll taxes, but there’s something else that many people don’t realise.</li>
<li>The Social Security system essentially lent the surpluses to the government, and the government used that money for many other purposes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixing Social Security: A menu of Options<ul>
<li>But there’s a menu of possible actions that could be taken to address the problem, and they all boil down to either increasing the revenues flowing into the program, or reducing the monies paid out.<ul>
<li>Raise the payroll tax rate.</li>
<li>Raise or gradually eliminate the Social Security payroll cap.</li>
<li>Expand the base of workers from whom the payroll tax is collected.</li>
<li>Allow more legal immigrants into the country.</li>
<li>Reduce benefits.</li>
<li>Raise the retirement age.</li>
<li>Introduce means testing.</li>
<li>Privatise the Social Security program.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>That’s another reason why the problem with Social Security has persisted — Social Security has been called the “third rail” of American politics because, metaphorically speaking, politicians who touch on this subject experience the same effect they would had they touched the electrified rail that runs along a subway track.</li>
<li>What you’ll probably discover is that there’s no single solution on which everyone can agree.</li>
<li>Failure to act on the issue today will only push the problem — and a drastically compounded problem at that — onto the backs of future generations.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Efficiency<ul>
<li>Efficiency is just what it sounds like, at least to an economist: the optimal production and allocation of resources.</li>
<li>In such a system, a high income would serve as a reward, or motivator, to get highly productive people producing even more. With highly productive people producing more, others in the economy would benefit. The economy would grow at a faster rate, more goods and services would be produced, and jobs would be created.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Equity<ul>
<li>Equity has to do with fairness or equality, but there are different ways of understanding what equity and equality mean.</li>
<li>One form of redistribution is the progressive income tax, the system that requires high earners to pay a larger proportion of their income in taxes than low earners are required to pay. Another form of income redistribution is government sending on welfare programs for poor people.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Welfare’s costs and benefits<ul>
<li>Some critics see the higher taxes needed to finance welfare spending as dampening the productive efforts of high earners.</li>
<li>Others argue that welfare benefits undermine the work ethic of recipients, and that economic growth suffered to the extent that welfare benefits discourage people from working.</li>
<li>Welfare spending’s greatest benefit may be its potential to lessen income inequality.<ul>
<li>Many people find value in feeling that they live in a country that is becoming more socially just, and when concerns about income inequality are eased by increased welfare spending, we’re better off as a society.</li>
<li>Some analysts argue that a high degree of income inequality may reduce a country’s rate of economic growth. Reducing income inequality would therefore benefit a country’s rate of economic growth.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The net effect of all of these factors is unknown at this time, but currently politicians believe that the funds spent on welfare programs are justified.</li>

<li>The healthcare industry is one of the nation’s most heavily regulated industries; the same is true in most nations, for that matter.</li>
<li>The vast majority of hospitals in the United States operate on a nonprofit basis, so they pursue goals aside from profit maximisation.</li>
<li>The healthcare market is characterised by asymmetric information and having an ill-defined product since the outcome of healthcare is uncertain.</li>
<li>Because of asymmetric information and an ill-defined product, not to mention the effects of injury and illness, healthcare consumers may make less rational decisions about healthcare than they do about other products.</li>
<li>Thanks to combinations of insurance premiums, co-payments, and government subsidies, consumers only rarely pay the full price for healthcare services.</li>
<li>Because the wedge between consumers and producers disguises true costs, consumers tend to overconsume healthcare services because they’re not paying the full costs.</li>
<li>By contrast, free market advocates argue that the government is already too involved in healthcare. Some who take this view also contend that government is the cause of the healthcare system’s problems.</li>
<li>Should the Healthcare Market Be Given Free Rein?<ul>
<li>There would be people who couldn’t afford health insurance.</li>
<li>There would be people, especially young and very healthy people, who would choose not to buy health insurance even if they could afford it.</li>
<li>In a pure market system, insurers would have the right to accept the customers they wanted to insure and turn away the rest.</li>
<li>People who have health insurance tend to overconsume healthcare, as we’ve seen, and their overconsumption drives up costs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What about a government-run, single-payer system?<ul>
<li>In a national healthcare system, all citizens have access to healthcare regardless of income, age, or health status.</li>
<li>Costs can also be more tightly controlled in a single-payer system — the government has virtually all the negotiating power, and a single payer can realise certain economics of scale that are not available in a multiplayer system.</li>
<li>Another advantage of a national healthcare system is that health insurance can be uncoupled from employment.</li>
<li>Yet a number of problems would likely appear in connection with a national healthcare system.<ul>
<li>The government would have to set standards for care, and some argue that ultimately the quantity and the quality of healthcare would decline.</li>
<li>People would find themselves waiting in long lines for treatment.</li>
<li>Rationing could become a reality, especially as the population ages and the demand for healthcare rises.</li>
<li>A national healthcare system could lead to more inefficiency and bureaucracy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Personal-thinking"><a href="#Personal-thinking" class="headerlink" title="Personal thinking"></a>Personal thinking</h1><p>Healthcare has always been one of the most basic and significant industries in the country because it provides citizens with treatment.</p>
<p>When learning about the merit and demerit goods, my Economics teacher told me that, and the textbooks wrote that, healthcare is a merit good because it still generates extra benefits, i.e. has positive externality. This chapter discusses about the ownership of the healthcare industry. Both private and public sector will have benefits and drawbacks. As a result, now in China, this industry has both sectors in order to make sure that people can choose their preference.</p>
<p>When reading this chapter, I have a question about the rational choices. As the treatment is somehow expensive in China, for example, it may took us more than several hundred thousand to treat the cancer which is a common illness in nowadays society, many people may give up treatment because they think even if they are incurred, they need to pay for the debt throughout their remaining life which is not worthy, while others may believe that they need to receive treatment, no matter how expensive it is. These are two kinds of people having different values. They may make different decisions although the benefits and costs to them are the same. It is never possible for the economists to analyse people case by case. They just provide a very general solution or explanation.</p>

    <title>IPQ - Literature review</title>
    <url>/2021/08/30/WORKS%202021-08-30%20IPQ%20Literature%20review/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Many scholars carried out a variety of surveys about the impact of COVID-19 on the aviation industry. Most of them studied the performance of the whole industry during COVID-19 instead of focusing on a simple airline company (Maneenop, 2020). Still, there are some surveys about predicting the future condition of the industry, like demand forecasting (Garrow, 2021). These findings all showed that the industry is suffering from low revenue or other problems like cash flow. Some economists paid much attention to these questions to help the whole industry recover and reduce the loss made because of COVID-19 in the whole society. </p>
<p>The first essay mentioned above (Maneenop, 2020) analyses the data, including shares prices, daily returns of the stock at a time, abnormal return of the stock, and fair values from airline companies worldwide. They found the underreaction to the announcement on January 13, 2020, when reporting the first case outside China. Also, they mentioned the overreaction on March 11, 2020, when WHO announced the COVID-19 as a pandemic.</p>
<p>The second essay mentioned above (Garrow, 2021) concludes the key themes of a program. The closure of borders has restricted the ability to exploit the benefits of alliances. However, it holds the opinion that the aviation industry has been seeing a slow and sustained recovery. To better develop the aviation industry, we need to increase the speed and flexibility in decision-making and rethink network planning. They still think COVID-19 is a catalyst for changing and shifting development priorities as fundamental changes in passenger demand and booking patterns have shifted development priorities within airline revenue management departments. Also, revenue management can contribute to demand forecasting. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, because the industry can be divided mainly into domestic and international services, this is another aspect of discussing the influences. In the paper (Suau-Sanchez, 2020), the authors believed that airline companies like British Airways might face huge problems as they have built a hub on sixth freedom traffic. The hub means they have the privilege of transporting international via the carrier’s home state, traffic moving between two other States. Also, they mentioned that the regional airlines might win in the short run. Focusing on a specific area like a continent and comparing two regions are widely discussed as well. There is an essay (Milena, 2021) paying attention to the European Union as they analysed the impacts of the global pandemic on the aviation industry of the EU and the development of their air transport. They also mentioned that the decrease in demand was mainly due to government regulation. The future development may be affected by the lasting time of the COVID-19 pandemic and the extent of trust of the consumer in the aviation industry, and the consumers’ economic situation. </p>
<p>Additionally, SARS in May 2003 was another widespread pandemic. As a result, many scholars analysed the difference and similarities between the impact of these two noticeable epidemics. An essay (Tay, 2021) can mainly be into three parts: the current situation, the comparison with SARS, and lessons learning from SARS and the future projection from two sides. They thought airline companies must prepare for both optimistic and pessimistic scenarios to unfold and prepare for future development. They also identified critical short-term and long-term measures which we can adapt to tide through this pandemic.</p>
<p>Many professors are looking at the problems and difficulties while they provide the industry with general suggestions. Some of them are more concentrated on the governmental policies released by the country government or local government and the international organisations like the United Nations. The essay (Tisdall, 2021) uses Australia as a case to find that the policymakers in the past had suffered from a lack of applied learning. From their points of view, we should design policies that support the aviation industry to engage all levels and stages in the aviation industry instead of being airline company-centric. </p>
<p>When looking at the inside strategy like a future business plan or the future strategy, scholars hope that their suggestions can be helpful to their short-term and long-term objectives, even including the most basic objective, which is survival and contribute to the sustainable development goals. In the essay (Dube, 2021), they analyse the impact of COVID-19 on the aviation industry and show some protocols about health and safety. A model is developed to help the airports operations during and post COVID-19 pandemic. It is noticeable that, as China is one of the first countries to recover using several new developed strategies, the scholar may use it as an example to gain experience lessons or develop their future opinions. For instance, the essay (Czerny, 2020) analyses the experience of China as China has been recovering. They review the way the Chinese government’s aviation policies influencing the recovery. However, it also mentioned that the way might not be able to be used by other countries. It may be better for them to use the British approach “travel corridor”.</p>
<p>Besides researching the aviation industry’s performance and future, scholars discussed some other problems or issues widely as well. The external value, for example, is discussed (Suau-Sanchez, 2020). They may think this is related to the companies’ plan. </p>
<p>This essay will discuss only one airline company, United Airlines, especially its current domestic and international markets performance, and provide individual suggestions. </p>

    <title>IPQ - Production Log1</title>
    <url>/2021/06/04/WORKS%202021-08-30%20IPQ%20Production%20Log1/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>\</em>My idea(s) for topic/title:**</strong></p>
<p>At the beginning, my supervisor asked us to write some keywords on a paper. My keywords include Costa Rica, COVID-19, investment banks, government policy, living standards, and UN supervision. These are all my areas of interest. However, as some of the topics, like the government policy and UN supervision, is not closely linked with Economics, so I did not consider them anymore. </p>
<p>I found I could combine Costa Rica with COVID-19 together. Also, I am very interested in Uganda located in southeast Africa. At first, I chose to do some research into Costa Rica and Uganda. I hoped to compare the influences of COVID-19 on the two countries. I have chosen this topic not only due to my interest but also because the pandemic of COVID-19 has caused a variety of problems in all industries which need to be solved. The title I have chosen is “Analysis of the influence of COVID-19 and provision of developing suggestions—— using Costa Rica and Uganda as examples”.</p>
<p>The living standard is still a good topic because it is connected with everyone. I thought developing a model for everyone to work out the country with the best living standards might be a good choice. This is my other choice because this model may help people to find the most suitable country for themselves which will contribute to individual living standards.</p>
<p><strong><em>\</em>My preliminary research and development of my project ideas:**</strong></p>
<p>I first did some research into Costa Rica and Uganda, and I found that the topic was too general to analyse. A country has many aspects which can be analysed, including its development, its economic system, its living standards, and so on. As a result, I decided to choose a representative industry. These two countries do have their popular industries. For example, Costa Rica is famous for medical equipment, food processing, and textiles and clothing. Uganda which depends more on the primary sector is strong in planting coffees, fishing, and growing maize. It is hard for me to find a representative industry in both countries. Finally, I decided to choose the aviation industry, because it is one of the strategic industries which was impacted by COVID-19 due to the travel ban and many other limitations. Then, I read some previous essays, for example, “The impacts of COVID-19 on the global airline industry: An event study approach” by Sakkakom Maneenop and Suntichai Kotcharin and “How COVID-19 is impacting and reshaping the airline industry” by Laurie Garrow and Virginie Lurkin. These essays provide me with an overall view of the current situation of the aviation industry. For example, I plan to find some information about the situation from the essays, such as the number of passengers and the changes in stock prices. Also, I may compare the essays which use different methods to work out the development plan to find a suitable method for me to use. My conclusion about the current situation and future development may hide in all this information. </p>
<p>When looking at the indicators of living standards which is the other interest I mentioned above, I found it had more things to do with Statistics instead of Economics, because we need to work out how to give weight to indicators when the users say they take one indicator into account most. As a result, I gave up this topic.</p>
<p><strong><em>\</em>My summary of the comments and advice from my supervisor (and specialist consultant if applicable):**</strong></p>
<p>My supervisor talked to me. She thought my topic was good because it was narrow and was planned carefully with clear details. However, she thought Costa Rica and Uganda might not be good choices. This is because Costa Rica and Uganda are not developed or famous countries. This results in little data available for me to fully analyse the current situation and provide suggestions. Also, as I could not decide which method to use after reading several essays even after comparing the methods. She recommended I combined SWOT analysis with PEST analysis, as SWOT is more about the internal situation and PEST is about the external situation. The combination will make the suggestions more comprehensive.</p>
<p><strong><em>\</em>Modifications I have made as a result of my discussion with my supervisor (and specialist consultant if applicable):**</strong></p>
<p>I started to look at the aviation industry in Costa Rica and Uganda and did some research. I found that there was exactly a lack of data due to low popularity. This is may also because the education level is low in these countries which causes that the number of local scholars is low as well. I chose to change from Costa Rica and Uganda to only the USA. Because of the contribution made by the government, the aviation industry in the USA has been recovered slowly. This is a frontier of recovery in the whole world. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, I spent some time reading around 14 methods that are useful for business analysis, including the famous ones like SWOT analysis and PEST analysis, and not famous ones like Benchmarking and EFE Matrix. I finally decide to use the SPACE Matrix with the help of SWOT analysis, and PEST analysis. This combination will make the suggestions comprehensive and scientific. </p>
<p>As a result, my title changed a little. It is now “Analysis of the influence of COVID-19 and provision of developing suggestions using the USA as an example with SPACE Matrix, SWOT Analysis and PEST Analysis”.</p>
<p>After reading the essays about the aviation industry and reports about airlines in the USA, I worked on several points I may pay attention to in future writing. These are “What can we conclude from the changes in the number of passengers and the number of seats offered?”; “What can we conclude from the income statements from different companies?”; “What can we conclude from the cash flow statements from different companies?”; “What can we conclude from the balance sheets from different companies?”; and “What can we conclude from the changes in stock prices?”. However, I may change these points in the future. </p>
<p><strong><em>\</em>My proposed title, aims and objectives:**</strong></p>
<p>Title: Analysis of the influence of COVID-19 and provision of developing suggestions using USA as an example with SPACE Matrix, SWOT Analysis, and PEST Analysis</p>
<p>Aims: Analyse the performance of the aviation industry in the USA using several famous airline companies as examples during COVID-19. Mainly use the data from the website and other studies. Explain the influence of regulation from government and international organisations. Provide suggestions for future development.</p>
<p>Objectives:</p>
<ol>
<li>Discuss the overall impact of COVID-19 on the whole aviation industry</li>
<li>Discuss the impact of COVID-19 on the USA aviation industry, including using data of share price, NYSE Arca Airline Index, passenger capacity, and volume of freight traffic</li>
<li>Discuss the impact of regulations from both the US government and international organisations like the UN</li>
<li>Discuss actions that have been taken to work out the future development suggestions</li>

    <title>IPQ - Introduction</title>
    <url>/2021/08/30/WORKS%202021-08-30%20IPQ%20Introduction/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>After the outbreak of the 2019 coronavirus at the beginning of 2020, it has changed everyone’s daily life both positively and negatively. Thousands of citizens suffered from the painful illness. COVID-19 also damages the business organisations, even some strategic industries, such as the agricultural and retail industries. The aviation industry, another strategic industry, is affected significantly as well because this industry is supervised and regulated a lot by the government and organisations like ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organisation). A lack of enough aviation industry services may result in a variety of problems. From the aspect of the passengers, it became more expensive to purchase a ticket. The increasing risks of travelling decrease the willingness of passengers to travel. Also, the regulation of the government and organisations influenced the companies like United Airlines. </p>
<p>The number of seats available for purchasing declined to keep the social distancing, decreasing the supply of airline services. As a result, the revenue may fall significantly, even operating at a loss. </p>
<p>Moreover, the companies still need to pay high fixed costs, such as salaries and aircraft depreciation. These may drive United Airlines into a challenging financial condition. Still, the share prices of United Airlines, for example, decreased by almost 70% in five weeks after the outbreak. </p>
<p>Research on the aviation industry has a long tradition. Some up-to-date studies analysed the impact of COVID-19 on it as well. However, the research on a specific company like United Airlines is still not sufficient. </p>
<p>In this paper, we want to investigate the influence of the COVID-19 on the aviation industry. We choose United Airlines as an example and will study their performance. Meanwhile, we will provide suggestions on how to survive or recover during this period. </p>
<p>The objectives in this paper are from several different aspects. Firstly, we will discuss the overall impact of COVID-19 on the whole aviation industry. Secondly, we will analyse the data of United Airlines, including three financial statements and stock conditions, to work out their current situation. Finally, we will give United Airlines some suggestions about future development. During the analysis process, we will use analysis methods, SPACE Matrix Analysis, to provide suggestions. </p>
<p>If we successfully fill this gap, this essay can act as a model for the managers of other aviation companies to gain ideas or inspirations of future development to firstly survive and then achieve other business objectives. </p>
<p>The rest of this paper is organised as follows. Section3 describes the methodology, which is SPACE Matrix Analysis. Section4 describes the current situation of the whole industry and United Airlines especially, and the future strategy for United Airlines. Section5 provides the conclusion.</p>

    <title>IPQ - Methodology</title>
    <url>/2021/08/30/WORKS%202021-08-30%20IPQ%20Methodology/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>SPACE Matrix is the primary method employed in the report. It stands for Strategic Position and ACtion Evaluation Matrix. It is a widely used method for analysing the competitive position of organisations (Radder, 1998). Clearly, using the SPACE Matrix in the report is significantly helpful. </p>
<p>It contains two internal dimensions: financial strength and competitive advantage, and two external dimensions with industry strength and environmental stability. Each dimension has around seven indicators. All the indicators are given a point between 0 and 6 to evaluate the level of each indicator. This provides people with a chance to get a numerical result that is more accurate than discussion-based ones. After getting the result of all the indicators, we can calculate the average, which is a benefit of using a numerical survey. Four dimensions together will show the result. The result is to work out the strategy in the industry. The classification mainly includes four kinds of strategic posture: aggressive, competitive, conservation or defensive. </p>
<p>The data I used during the analysis process is from several providers, including ICAO, IATA, and United Airlines. We analyse the data from their reports that helps us work out the current situation of United Airlines. </p>

    <title>Thinking on Economics Through Everyday Life Chapter7 Booms, bubbles, &amp; busts</title>
    <url>/2022/02/07/RR%202022-02-07%20Economics%20through%20everyday%20life%20Chapter7/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h1 id="Extract"><a href="#Extract" class="headerlink" title="Extract"></a>Extract</h1><h2 id="PartA-The-basics-of-business-cycles"><a href="#PartA-The-basics-of-business-cycles" class="headerlink" title="PartA The basics of business cycles"></a>PartA The basics of business cycles</h2><ul>
<li>We can blame animal spirits, irrational exuberance, or the bogeyman for that matter, but booms and bubbles — and the busts that result — have been recurring features of our economy for at least as long as economic data has been recorded.</li>
<li>The terms booms, bubble, and bust are used in the financial press because they have a dramatic ring to them, but they belong to a broader discussion of business cycles, a discussion that uses terms that aren’t nearly so dramatic.</li>
<li>Economics activity tends to rise and fall over time, and these fluctuations are commonly referred to as business cycles.</li>
<li>The presence and phases of business cycles are typically indicated and measured by changes in real GDP over time.</li>
<li>A single business cycle has four basic phases<ul>
<li>At the peak of a business cycle, total production in the economy is temporarily maxed out.</li>
<li>After the economy peaks, it goes into recession.</li>
<li>A business cycle bottoms out at its trough, or low point. In the trough, real GDP is at a temporary minimum, and — unless other negative influences come into play — unemployment is at a temporary maximum.</li>
<li>The expansion phase of the business cycle begins just after the trough, and it entails the economy’s climb toward a new peak.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="PartB-What-causes-business-cycles"><a href="#PartB-What-causes-business-cycles" class="headerlink" title="PartB What causes business cycles?"></a>PartB What causes business cycles?</h2><ul>
<li>Through years of observation and research, however, economists have identified two major factors that definitely influence business cycles<ul>
<li>Economic shocks<ul>
<li>These are unforeseen events that affect the economy and can create fluctuations in business activity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Monetary policy</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Throughout the 1990s and into the first few years of the current century — the period of “irrational exuberance” — some analysts began to wonder whether the business cycle might even be dead. Then, in late 2007, along came a financial crisis to remind everyone that business cycles are alive and well, and that no one has yet come up with a satisfactory answer to the question of what causes them.</li>
<li>Cyclical unemployment doesn’t appear in the expansionary phase of the business cycle. It only appears in the trough or during a recession.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="PartC-Recessions-and-depressions"><a href="#PartC-Recessions-and-depressions" class="headerlink" title="PartC Recessions and depressions"></a>PartC Recessions and depressions</h2><ul>
<li>As the old economics joke has it, in a recession, your neighbours lose their jobs; in a depression, you lose yours.</li>
<li>Recessions in the United States<ul>
<li>Since the end of World War II, according to the NBER, there have been 11 recessions in the United States.</li>
<li>A key feature of any recession is a broad economic downturn, but a recession doesn’t affect all industries and all firms in the same way.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Great Depression<ul>
<li>The Great Depression truly was “great”. No economic downturn that our country has experienced since then has equaled the Depression’s severity or its economic impact in terms of unemployment, falling stock prices, bank failures, personal bankruptcies, and all-around pain and suffering.</li>
<li>In addition to our improved understanding of the economy and monetary economics, we now have a social safety net, a system of protections that mostly didn’t exist during the Great Depression.</li>
<li>Given everything we’ve learned up to this point in our history, a repeat of the Great Depression looks like a very remote possibility.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="PartD-From-boom-to-bubble-to-bust"><a href="#PartD-From-boom-to-bubble-to-bust" class="headerlink" title="PartD From boom to bubble to bust"></a>PartD From boom to bubble to bust</h2><ul>
<li>Some people use the terms expansion and boom fairly interchangeably, and there’s actually no technical distinction between an expansion and a boom.</li>
<li>Often a boom indicates that the economy is overheating, and that suppliers of goods and services are suddenly unable to keep up with demand.</li>
<li>When prices of certain assets, such as stocks or real estate, aren’t supported by the underlying fundamentals — the factors that determine the actual market value of those assets — it’s often said that a bubble, or asset bubble, has developed (synonymous terms include speculative bubble, market bubble, and price bubble).</li>
<li>An economic boom is typically followed by an economic bust. During a bust, real GDP falls, unemployment rises, and any asset bubbles that have been brewing are not set to burst.</li>
<li>In the summer of 2015, there was a drastic drop in the prices of Chinese stocks. It turned out that the Chinese government had created an asset bubble by reporting an inaccurate growth rate for the Chinese economy.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="PartE-The-2007-2008-financial-crisis-Who’s-to-blame"><a href="#PartE-The-2007-2008-financial-crisis-Who’s-to-blame" class="headerlink" title="PartE The 2007-2008 financial crisis: Who’s to blame?"></a>PartE The 2007-2008 financial crisis: Who’s to blame?</h2><ul>
<li>Entire books have been written about the crisis, but in summary it began with a housing bubble fuelled by low interest rates engineered by the Fed, combined with the federal government’s encouragement for almost every American to own a home, if possible.</li>
<li>Vast numbers of home loans, including a large number of subprime loans, were sold on the secondary market by the original leaders. These loans were then bundled together, and the bundles were used to create opportunities for investors.</li>
<li>Wall Street firms began to create additional investment opportunities by issuing various kinds of derivatives, or financial instruments related to the mortgage-backed securities.</li>
<li>When housing prices finally reached unsustainable levels, the bubble burst, and the house of cards collapsed. Housing prices rapidly dropped by hundreds of thousands of dollars.</li>
<li>Many lessons have been learned from the 2007-2008 financial crisis, and there are still more to be gleaned fro retroactive examination of the facts.<ul>
<li>The Fed’s low interest rates laid the foundation for a housing bubble to develop, but the low interest rates in and of themselves didn’t cause the bubble.</li>
<li>The fact that some mortgage companies engaged in questionable lending practices contributed to the problem, but the mortgage companies wouldn’t have been able to make so many subprime loans if the money had not been so readily available, and if the government hadn’t implicitly endorsed such weak lending standards.</li>
<li>The esoteric financial instruments created and marketed by Wall Street firms definitely added to the problem, but there wouldn’t have been so many of those instruments if there hadn’t been so many subprime loans availed for bundling.</li>
<li>Borrowers were sometimes the targets of predatory lending, but perhaps they should have known that they were taking out bigger loans than they could afford.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Clearly, there’s plenty of blame to go around for the housing bubble and the financial crisis that followed. The question of who deserves the most blame is one that will probably never have a definitive answer, at least not from anyone who tries to analyse these events objectively.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Personal-thinking"><a href="#Personal-thinking" class="headerlink" title="Personal thinking"></a>Personal thinking</h1><p>These days, I watched several documentaries about the financial crisis happened by the end of the first decade of the 21st century, most of which provided basic introduction of the process from the beginning to the final solution of the crisis. </p>
<p>From my point of view, combined with the ideas of the documentaries and this chapter, every stakeholders in that financial crisis had part of the responsibility. For example, the investment banks such as the Lehman Brothers and Goldman, were accountable for the purchase of the subprime loans. The consulting companies provided wrong levels for the high risk loans. However, at the same time, all the stakeholders born some loss, such as Lehman Brothers as mentioned before which faced bankruptcy first, and the consulting companies which were almost bankrupt.</p>
<p>There are still many people in this case, including the general public. They suffered more because some of them even lost all their life savings and their house and became homeless. It is always hard for us to imagine the impact of slight changes in the era will have on an individual can be how great, saying nothing of huge events like financial crisis. </p>
<p>Sometimes I think, if possible in the future, I would like to discover a much more precise and accurate model for all the government to use to estimate the future trends of the country economic condition. Although the author thought that sudden crisis could not be predicted, I still believe that there are some clues for us to find and use before the crisis. This can greatly contribute to the human beings well being.</p>

    <title>IPQ - Production Log2</title>
    <url>/2021/07/11/WORKS%202021-08-30%20IPQ%20Production%20Log2/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>\</em>Working title of my International Independent Project.*****</strong>*Present the topic to be researched in the form of a short statement/question/hypothesis with clear focus.****</p>
<p>Analyse the influence of COVID-19 on the aviation industry and provide suggestions on their future development using SWOT &amp; PEST &amp; SPACE matrix analysis——Using United Airline as an example</p>
<p><strong><em>\</em>My initial resources will be**</strong></p>
<p>My initial resources will be the essays I found when doing initial research about the global aviation industry. Also, I found more reports that may contribute to my paper, like the ones which talk about the influences of SARS on the aviation industry. I will continue to find more resources that concentrate mainly on the aviation industry in the USA, especially United Airlines.</p>
<p>The essays include but are not limited to “Annual report of 2020” by United Airlines; “Effects of Novel Coronavirus(COVID-19) on Civil Aviation: Economic Impact Analysis” by ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organisation); “The impacts of COVID-19 on the global airline industry: An event study approach” by Sakkakom Maneenop and Suntichai Kotcharin; “How COVID-19 is impacting and reshaping the airline industry” by Laurie Garrow and Virginie Lurkin.  </p>
<p><strong><em>\</em>The courses of study or area(s) of personal interest to which the topic relates**</strong></p>
<p>I hope to study Economics or Data Science at university. This topic will help me improve several basic skills like analysis, doing research, and solving problems. What is noteworthy is that we can divide this topic into several parts. The separation will contribute to my ability to the classified discussion. In addition, as some of the components may not have a definitive correct answer, sometimes I can criticise my opinion from other aspects. This process will make me be more good at critical thinking. All the skills mentioned above can help me develop better logic which is very important in Economics or Data Science. </p>
<p>Also, it is like industrial research. I have not covered anything to do with this before in both Economics and Business Studies. </p>
<p><strong><em>\</em>My project aims and objectives**</strong></p>
<p>I plan to write a 5000-word report on the stated title. My writing will involve mainly five parts, including the introduction, literature review, methodology, discussion, and conclusion. To respond to my title, the discussion part will be about three questions: “How does COVID-19 influence the aviation industry?”; “How does COVID-19 influence United Airlines?”; “What can United Airlines do next to develop better?”</p>
<p>To achieve the product, I will first go through the essays I got and make a table to clarify the topic. After that, I will use the data to analyse the current situation of the aviation industry and United Airlines with the help of the annual reports. Then, I may spend some time learning more about my methods. Using the three methods to analyse will be the future step. During this process, I will keep finding more resources, including books, journals, and essays. </p>

    <title>IPQ - Production Log4</title>
    <url>/2021/08/08/WORKS%202021-08-30%20IPQ%20Production%20Log4/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>\</em>Is my project following my original plan? How has my plan developed?**</strong></p>
<p>My project followed my planning table mostly. The changes in methodology influenced several stages. As a result, I have changed the details in the planning table. I think this is adequate. </p>
<p>I. Successes<br>Recently I have managed to finish the literature table and literature review. The table helps me use the information more quickly in the future. I have also talked to my supervisor again to check whether I can use my output. Also, I read the annual report from ICAO ( International Civil Aviation Organisation) about the situation of the whole industry in 2020. I selected several data which I thought was helpful. These data will help me work out the current situation of the aviation industry to respond to my first question.<br>Also, I read the annual report from United Airlines’ website. I found the income statement, cash flow statement and balance sheet.</p>
<p>II. Failure<br>The data is available. However, there is still some data that I need to use in the part of SPACE Matrix being not available. For example, the price elasticity of demand needs to use a questionnaire. However, I do not know the consumers of United Airlines, so I can not carry out the questionnaire to achieve it.<br>Meanwhile, I have some difficulties analysing them, although I have some resources for analysing. I keep reading books, like the textbook of A-Level Business Study, to make sure that there are fewer mistakes in my report. </p>
<p><strong><em>\</em>My summary of the comments and advice from my supervisor (and specialist consultant if applicable).**</strong></p>
<p>My supervisor provided me with the most positive comments. She said that I had followed my planning table well. My essay plan was suitable, which means it is reasonable and well organised. Also, she said that my changes in methodology were correct because using a single method would help me have more clear logic in the report. Also, using three or two methods may make me have too much load, which means I may not achieve the report before the deadline. This change would help me pay more attention to the strategy as well. </p>
<p>Also, she mentioned the presentation I would do in the future. She suggested that I start preparing for it, including the slides and what I want to show. Also, as I am not good at giving a presentation, I may start to practise.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I may start to write the discussion part, especially the former part about the current situation of the aviation industry and United Airlines.</p>
<p>I also talked to a specialist. She thought my report had been very logical and well organised. I explained the SPACE Matrix to her. She thought this method was more suitable and reasonable than my previous choices, including SWOT and PEST analysis. However, she suggested that I talk to my supervisor to determine whether some indicators in SPACE Matrix can be combined or deleted. This change would make my report clearer.</p>
<p><strong><em>\</em>Modifications I have made as a result of my discussion with my supervisor at this stage (and specialist consultant if applicable).**</strong></p>
<p>After talking to my supervisor and specialist, I began to research each indicator of the SPACE Matrix. I found some scholars said that when they were using the SPACE Matrix, they would provide each indicator with a weight based on the importance of each indicator to the industry. Also, they sometimes even ignore some indicators. However, I am not the authority in the aviation industry, and there were no previous researches using SPACE Matrix in the aviation industry. I finally decided to not follow the instruction from the specialist.</p>
<p>Also, I changed my planning table again to make the time for completing the discussion part earlier. After that, I can have more time for correcting what I have written and changing the details. </p>
<p>I started to prepare for my presentation. I have decided that it will contain why I choose this topic, how I developed my report and what I have found. Also, there will be a question and answer part. After finishing writing it, I will go over my report to make sure I can answer the questions clearly and logically. </p>
<p><strong><em>\</em>My final title, aims and objectives.**</strong></p>
<p>My final title is —— Analyse the influence of COVID-19 on the aviation industry and provide suggestions on future development using SPACE Matrix analysis. This title allows me to concentrate in United Airlines and its strategy. My project will be in the form of a 5000-word discussion-based report, including an introduction, literature review, methodology, discussion, and conclusion. This report will analyse the current situation of the aviation industry and United Airlines using all kinds of data from annual reports and previous research and evaluate the strategy for United Airlines to take using SPACE Matrix based on the background of COVID-19. </p>
<p><strong><em>\</em>My planned next steps to achieve my project’s aims and objectives.**</strong></p>
<p>My next steps are to complete the discussion part of my report, as I have finished writing the introduction and literature review before the deadline I set in the planning table. I also plan to create a presentation before the end of the summer holiday. I will go through all the information I obtained for discussion. This action will help me work out the discussion. I plan to finish it by 20th August. After that, I will spend two days writing the methodology and conclusion. Then, I plan to finish my presentation, including the slides and lecture, before 24th August. I will still spend several days on my Production Log before 30th August. As I am doing other things, including summer school, at the same time, there may be slight changes in the deadline date. I will complete everything before 31st August. </p>

    <title>IPQ - Production Log6</title>
    <url>/2021/08/31/WORKS%202021-08-30%20IPQ%20Production%20Log6/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>\</em>Planned format of my 10 minute presentation (eg audience, use of visual aids, slides, use of notes, etc).**</strong></p>
<p>For my presentation, I plan to have a 10-minute talk, which has two topics, including my IPQ report introduction, reflection, and prospective influences. The audience will include my supervisor, some teachers and other students in my class.</p>
<p>At the end of the presentation, there will be around 10 minutes, during which time my supervisor and audience are permitted to pose questions about any aspect of my project. As a result, I have gone through my presentation and report several times to make sure I am clear about every detail.</p>
<p>As I mentioned above, there are three topics. Each topic includes an averagely of four slides. I will use the slides for the presentation, which contain the bullet points about the topics and explain them more detailedly. There are some pictures on the slides to prevent the slides from looking dull. Meanwhile, to avoid forgetting some essential points, I made a list containing all the points I need to mention. The list can help me carry out the presentation more logically as well.</p>
<p><strong><em>\</em>Planned content of my presentation.**</strong></p>
<p>• Project process:</p>
<p>My presentation will follow this plan:</p>
<p>At the beginning of the introduction, I will explain why I chose the topic related to the aviation industry and COVID-19. After that, I will discuss my aims and objectives to make sure the audiences are clear about my report structure. I will then talk about the methodology because I chose the SPACE Matrix Analysis, which is not famous. I will explain why I have chosen this topic and how I employed it. Then I will talk about the results of my report. </p>
<p>The second topic, the reflection, contains several points. I will go through the process of developing the report and then discuss both my success and failure. There are several skills or pieces of knowledge I have learnt as well. Finally, I will talk about my improvements in the future. </p>
<p>The last topic, which is the prospective influences, is mostly positive. </p>
<p>• Project findings and conclusions:</p>
<p>I pay attention to the influence of COVID-19 on United Airlines and use the SPACE Matrix Analysis to work out the future strategy for United Airlines. I looked into the data from several reports, including the cash flow statement, balance sheet, income statement and stock conditions. Also, I gave points to all the indicators of the SPACE Matrix to make sure the result was as correct as possible. In conclusion, United Airlines is suffering from COVID-19 and is in a pessimistic situation. I suggest the company take defensive actions, including decreasing the costs and investment. </p>
<p><strong><em>\</em>Modifications I have made as a result of rehearsal and/or discussion with my supervisor (and specialist consultant if applicable):**</strong></p>
<p>I received primarily optimistic feedbacks on my presentation and slides. My supervisor thought the structure was clear, and the whole presentation was logical. </p>
<p>She provided me with several suggestions as well. </p>
<p>Firstly, in the introduction topic, she said the literature review part was too long to cover in 10 minutes. I made some modifications to this arrangement. I decided to use a slide to cover the literature review, which summarises all the essays. Also, I will move it to the topic of reflection when I talk about the things I have done during this process. This is because this change can make the introduction topic concentrate more on the results than the process. Meanwhile, the reflection can pay more attention to the process of developing reports. </p>
<p>Secondly, the design of my slides was not excellent. Although I chose only to use the bullet points to present, there were still too many words on the slide. As a result, I replaced some simple explanations with the pictures like the aeroplanes of United Airlines to remind the audience of my topic. However, this change would make my talking more difficult because it required me to remember more details in my mind. I decided to write a more completed note for me to prepare for the presentation. </p>
<p>Additionally, I still need to spend more time practising my presentation skills. At present, I rely on the note much. I should try my best to get rid of this habit. </p>

    <url>/2021/08/20/WORKS%202021-08-30%20IPQ%20Production%20Log5/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>\</em>Did my project follow my revised plan from the mid-project review?**</strong></p>
<p>Success</p>
<p>In the end, I managed to finish my discussion part, including the current situation of the aviation industry and United Airlines and the future strategy of United Airlines. This achievement means I was successful to follow up on my revised plan. The outline of what I planned to write and what evidence to back it up helped tremendously in what direction I should take the essay. </p>
<p>I finished some parts of my presentation, including the background information about why I chose this topic and some parts about the methodology. </p>
<p>Failure</p>
<p>I expected that I could work out all the results and then start to write the discussion part. However, I attended a summer school aimed at scholar achievements for most of this period, which finished on 20th August. I was only able to write the discussion part and work out the result at the same time. I do not think this is an excellent way to develop the report.</p>
<p><strong><em>\</em>My summary of the comments and advice from my supervisor at this final stage (and specialist consultant if applicable).**</strong></p>
<p>My supervisor provided me with mostly positive feedbacks after I submitted the first draft of my written report. She said that the structure was completed and logical. Also, the introduction and literature review parts are completed well with details. She thought my conclusion was clear, and the reference was good as well. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, my supervisor pointed out that the discussion part needed to be changed. She said that the first part of my discussion, which is the analysis of the current situation of the aviation industry and United Airlines, was not logical. She advised me to read more books, including the A-Level Business Study textbook, to understand analysis. She thought the part in which I analysed the three statements needed to be changed chiefly. She even suggested that I should rewrite them if possible. Also, she mentioned that as SPACE Matrix was a new method for everyone, there were still mistakes. She suggested that I should pay more attention to the reliability of data. </p>
<p><strong><em>\</em>Modifications I have made as a result of discussion with my supervisor (and specialist consultant if applicable) at this final stage.**</strong></p>
<p> <strong><em>\</em>Do I need to do anything else to complete my project?**</strong></p>
<p>As a result of the meeting with the supervisor, I went back through my report. I found that some of my analysis was unreliable. It does not contain reliable evidence. So I may spend approximately two days reading more resources about the analysis of the three statements of companies. The reading may help me write the first part better and more logical. I plan to complete the rewrite before 22nd August and complete my presentation at the same time. </p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>While completing the IPQ report, I have learnt a lot about the Business analysis and the current situation of individual companies like United Airlines, the individual industry like the aviation industry and the whole economy. Before this project, I did not understand how to analyse a company’s current situation. I studied how to read and analyse the cash flow statement, income statement, balance sheet, and stock condition by myself by reading textbooks and watching videos online. Meanwhile, I started to understand that the choices of analysis methods play an essential role in business analysis because this determines the result of the analysis. Analysis into the future strategy for United Airlines using the SPACE Matrix Analysis gave me an appreciation for the extensive effort of the Economics and Business field.</p>
<p>To reflect, I will say I enjoy the process of researching by myself most. As I mentioned above and in the presentation, the processes of finding a suitable method and reading a variety of the previous studies provided me with the most joy. From my point of view, these skills I learnt during IPQ will benefit my work not only at university but also at the present stage of learning. This benefit is because I understood profoundly finding resources and evaluating them, reading previous essays, taking notes, developing reports, and preparing for the presentation. I like the report most. It provided me with the most rewards because it can show me all the efforts I had devoted to developing the project. </p>
<p>I believe that the major successes of my project have been from four aspects. Firstly, I have chosen an appropriate topic because the topic is both narrowed and worth discussing. This topic allows me to discuss all my aims and objectives clearly and detailedly instead of spending fewer words on one objective. Meanwhile, I think I have a helpful literature table. It contains a variety of information, including the title, the researcher, the sources of the researches, the main aims of the research and their results. The table contains almost all the information I need while writing the report——this saved time for me. At the same time, this table allowed me to be clear about all the resources and increased my productivity. </p>
<p>Additionally, I had a detailed plan for the process of developing the project. Although I changed it several times due to the changes I made in the report structure, the table still played an essential role. For example, it allowed me to write the report in the summer much more straightforwards. The plan increased my efficiency by a considerable extent. Also, it allowed enough time after finishing the writing for proofreading and double-checking. </p>
<p>There are several failures during the project. For example, during August, I was busy attending a summer school aimed at academic achievements. Summer school took most of my time. However, I still planned to finish writing some parts of my discussion to ensure I can complete everything before the deadline. At that time, I ended up having a large workload. </p>
<p>To sum up, while making the plan, I overestimated my spare time and my extra energy. Meanwhile, I thought I spent too much time finishing the literature table and literature review, although the table is helpful and excellent. However, I still found that I did not fully use almost half of the information during proofreading. If I had spent less time, I might start writing the discussion part earlier and proofreading and double-checking. </p>
<p>If I were to undertake the project again, I would improve the logic of planning. As I mentioned above, sometimes I was extremely overload. Additionally, during the process, I talked to my supervisor only several times. Sometimes the direction of my writing went wrong. If I had talked to my supervisor more frequently, I could avoid the mistakes in direction and save some time. </p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that I thought I had developed several vital skills during the project. Firstly, based on the thought about the planning table, I start to understand more about time management. This skill will benefit me after attending higher grades because we will have more time for self-studying. Meanwhile, I found a helpful way for myself to develop self-studying. The way can contribute to my study when my teachers and supervisors can not provide me with supports immediately. Lastly, this also taught me to collect and collate information and data efficiently. As I have decided to major in Economics at the university, this will help me during quantitative analysis. </p>
<p>A piece of advice I would give to prospective students is to choose a narrowed and concentrated topic. An appropriate topic will provide the students with a clear pathway to develop the whole project. Also, this will significantly decrease the workload. If you choose to carry on a broad topic that includes tens of the subtopics, you need to read many essays and previous studies. Meanwhile, as there is a limitation of 4500 to 5500 words, too many topics may make the analysis and explanation roughly. </p>
<p>Additionally, I advise them to devote as much as possible effort and time to the project. The more you devote will show in the final report. IPQ project can strictly provide students with an excellent opportunity to feel the exciting areas more directly. This chance can help them decide their future majors as well. </p>

    <title>IPQ - Production Log3</title>
    <url>/2021/07/18/WORKS%202021-08-30%20IPQ%20Production%20Log3/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>\</em>My next steps in planning, researching and deadlines that I will set myself. What I intend to do, by when, what resources I will use and how I will implement the recommendations of the centre coordinator (where appropriate).**</strong></p>
<p>I have thought about the comments made by my supervisor about my proposal. She told me that it was better for me to narrow my topic down by employing fewer analysis methods because three methods may be redundant. I did some research on the three methods I employed, and I agree with her. As a result, I changed my title to “Analyse the influence of COVID-19 on the aviation industry and provide suggestions on their future development using SWOT &amp; SPACE matrix analysis——Using United Airline as an example”. The change is because I found that both SPACE Matrix Analysis and PEST Analysis are about external analysis. A more narrowed title will allow me to pay more attention to one analysis method much more intensely, which will help me work out a more detailed report. </p>
<p>I also decided to organise my logic again. The discussion part will respond from 3 questions to 4 questions, including “How does COVID-19 influence the aviation industry?”; “How does COVID-19 influence Unit Airlines when looking at the three statements and stock condition?”; “What strategy will United Airlines employ in the future?”; “What detailed plan can United Airlines employ in the future?”. These questions help me build a connection between SPACE Matrix and SWOT Analysis. SPACE Matrix can act as the base of SWOT Analysis, as it can work out the strategy, and SWOT can be used to analyse the detailed plans within the strategy. From my point of view, this will make my report clearer and more logical. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, my supervisors and centre coordinator suggested that I develop more literature reviews, even including essays analysing other industries to work out the aspects of analysing. I started to read more essays. The resources, for example, include “The aviation industry: Tackling the turbulence caused by COVID-19” by Deborah Tay; “COVID-19 and business renewal: Lessons and insights from the global airline industry” by Joseph Amankwah-Amoah; “Will the Aviation industry have a bright future after the COVID-19 outbreak? Evidence from Chinese Airport shipping sector” by Jingxuan Liu.</p>
<p><strong><em>\</em>The reasons for my decisions.**</strong></p>
<p>I plan to achieve this by reading essays I collected before. I also want to talk to a worker responsible for his or her company’s financial condition analysis and future development plan. He or she may help me analyse all the statements more clearly because of the practical experience. </p>
<p>I also want to learn more about the SPACE Matrix as it is a method I found instead of being taught in class. I may look at specific books which aim at explaining the principle and usage of SPACE Matrix.</p>
<p><strong><em>\</em>My summary of the comments and advice from my supervisor (and specialist consultant if applicable).**</strong></p>
<p>During my meeting with my supervisor, I mainly received the positive feedbacks given by my supervisor. She said that my title and the main structure of my report were great because they are specific and focused. Also, my introduction, which includes enough background information and discussion about why it is a gap worth filling, is suitable. She also said that my methods are too complicated. My supervisor highlights the literature table and literature review, which means I need to write them more detailedly and carefully. Additionally, she thought only analysing United Airlines is not proper for me to use China as an example. </p>
<p>When discussing the structure of the essay, we decided to increase the words spent on the literature review and change words on the methodology because of the change in methods. Also, as I am doing a discussion-based essay, most information is collected from others essays and the companies’ annual or quarterly reports about their condition, especially the three statements. </p>
<p>When looking at my planning table, she thought it was detailed and suitable, which means it is achievable and reasonable. It would help me manage my time more appropriately in the future.</p>
<p><strong><em>\</em>Modifications I have made as a result of my discussion with my supervisor (and specialist consultant if applicable).**</strong></p>
<p>In order to respond to my supervisor’s advice, I decided only to use SPACE Matrix analysis which I think is the most suitable one. This decision can help me work out the future strategy of United Airlines based on the background of COVID-19 more scrupulously.</p>
<p>Also, I have mentioned above, the questions I would pay attention to have been changed. Due to the change in methods, I need to change it again. I change them into six questions, including “How does COVID-19 influence the aviation industry (using ICAO’s annual report about the whole civil aviation industry?”; “How does COVID-19 influence Unit Airlines when looking at the three statements and stock condition?”; “What is the financial strength of United Airlines?”; “What is the industrial attractiveness of United Airlines?”; “What is the environmental stability of aviation industry?”; “What is the competitive advantage of the aviation industry?”.</p>
<p>I found a detailed article called “The SPACE Matrix: A Tool for Calibrating Competition” by Laetitia Radder and Lynette Louw. They explained the indicators in SPACE Matrix clearly and used three organisations in the South African Industry to explain. </p>

<p>It is noticeable that in 2020 United Airlines had operating revenue smaller than its operating expense, which means it made a loss this year. This happened for the first time during the recent five years.</p>

<p>Table. 2. Operating expense of United Airline (in millions, except percentage changes) </p>
<p>Source: UAL. “2020 Annual Report.” <strong>United Airlines</strong>, 1 Mar. 2021, <a href="https://ir.united.com/static-files/a30cf7ec-7b4a-4fd9-9ae3-2656e9d53f24">https://ir.united.com/static-files/a30cf7ec-7b4a-4fd9-9ae3-2656e9d53f24</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, the operating loss in 2020 is almost twice the operating income in 2018, while the net loss in 2020 is more than three times the quantity of net income in 2018, although the expense has decreased significantly. This situation appears because United Airlines still need to pay high fixed costs, including salaries and related costs, depreciation and amortisation, lading fees and other rent, and regional capacity purchase. These costs are impossible to reduce by a large extent. However, the revenue decreased significantly because of the travel restrictions. It may take several years to cover the loss because this situation may continue in 2021, and the recovery is relatively slow. It is hard for it to gain it again in the recession environment in the whole society. In conclusion, in 2020, the profitability of United Airlines is negative. </p>
<p>We can use the balance sheet to identify the financial position of United Airlines. It mainly has three aspects, including assets, liabilities and stockholders’ equity. </p>

<p>Table. 3. Balance sheet (in millions) </p>
<p>Source: UAL. “2020 Annual Report.” <strong>United Airlines</strong>, 1 Mar. 2021, <a href="https://ir.united.com/static-files/a30cf7ec-7b4a-4fd9-9ae3-2656e9d53f24">https://ir.united.com/static-files/a30cf7ec-7b4a-4fd9-9ae3-2656e9d53f24</a>.</p>
<p>The balance sheet provides information about the trend in the changes in assets and liabilities. The total assets and total current show an increasing trend. The current liabilities reached a peak in 2019, while the total liabilities keep rising until 2020. Stockholders’ equity, an essential data considered by the investors, has risen for four years. This increase is an advantage to the investors. </p>
<p>The current ratio, another data considered, has the formula to calculate. </p>

<p>We can use the data in Table. 5. to calculate the trend of current ratio. </p>

<p>The current ratio increased significantly. The figure for 2020 is more than twice the figure for the previous three years. As the airline companies are very special, figures around 0.5 seem to be more common. For example, the current ratio of Delta Air Lines in 2019 is 0.41. This increase may be disadvantageous because a current ratio larger than 1.0 may show that the company has too much money in their account. If the money is not used efficiently, it can not create maximum value for the company. </p>
<p>Information, including the trend of the stockholders’ equity, the trend of assets and liabilities, and the current ratio, shows that United Airlines is performing better and better even under the broad background of COVID-19.</p>
<p>In the current environment, airline companies like United Airlines need to consider cash flow because cash may strap the company, and cash flow is a prerequisite for survival. </p>

<p>Net income, one of the essential indicators considered by the investors, decreased in 2020, while the net cash provided by (used in) operating activities has a similar trend. The decrease is not a good signal. All the data shows that United Airlines was in a dire cash flow condition in 2020. </p>
<p>Share prices, also known as stock price, is another indicator of the company’s performance.</p>
<p>United Airlines’ common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “UAL”(United Airlines, 2021).</p>

<p>Source: UAL. “2020 Annual Report.” <strong>United Airlines</strong>, 1 Mar. 2021, <a href="https://ir.united.com/static-files/a30cf7ec-7b4a-4fd9-9ae3-2656e9d53f24">https://ir.united.com/static-files/a30cf7ec-7b4a-4fd9-9ae3-2656e9d53f24</a>.</p>
<p>The graph provides information about the cumulative total stockholder return for UAL’s common stock and the cumulative returns of the Standard and Poor’s 500 Index (“SPX”) and the NYSE Arca Airline Index (“XAL”) of 15 investor-owned airlines during the five years.</p>
<p>UAL showed an increasing trend in the first four years from $100 to more than $150, but in 2020 it dropped dramatically to approximately $70. XAL had a similar trend. However, the extent it changed is slighter than UAL. SPX is different. It kept rising from $100 to $190 by the end. </p>
<p>United Airlines had almost the average performance in the aviation industry. Additionally, we can find that the overall aviation industry, also United Airlines, performed worse than the whole economy. </p>
<p>In conclusion, United Airlines did not perform well in 2020 from many aspects, including the cash flow, income and stock prices, mainly due to COVID-19. Luckily, the whole industry and economy are recovering slowly (ICAO, 2021). </p>
<p>II. Provide suggestions on future development</p>
<p>The following part will use SPACE Matrix Analysis which stands for Strategic Position and ACtion Evaluation Matrix. We use SPACE Matrix Analysis to work out the strategy of United Airlines in the future. It contains four dimensions, including financial strength, competitive advantage, industry strength and environmental stability. The former two are the internal ones, while the latter two are the external ones. Each dimension has around seven indicators. In the following part, we will discuss each dimension. At the beginning of each dimension, we will show all the dimensions’ indicators and then discuss them respectively. All the indicators will be given a point from 0 to 6 to evaluate the level of each indicator. After discussing all the indicators of one dimension, we will calculate the average point of all the indicators. Four dimensions together will show the result. </p>
<p>We will firstly talk about Environmental stability. It has many indicators, including technological changes, inflation rate, demand variability, the price range of competing products, barriers to entry into the market, competitive pressure, and the price elasticity of demand (Radder, 1998). </p>
<p>Technological change is a shift to a new production function resulting from an increase in the efficiency of a product or process. The shift is the primary source of potential economic growth, which an outward shift of the Productive Possibility Curve of a company, an industry, or the whole economy can represent. United Airlines highly depends on technology. It is reported that in 2021 the Company booked 25 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft (United Airlines, 2021). Also, many media said that the Company had an upcoming IT investment (Malone, 2021). I will give point 1 to technological changes.</p>
<p>Competitive pressure affects a company’s incentives to undertake product and process innovations (Boone, 2000). The aviation industry is a highly competitive market, although we mentioned above that it is an oligopoly. So I will give point 1 to competitive pressure. </p>
<p>The price range of competing products is another indicator. Competing products can be understood as substitutes. There are lots of substitutes for the products of United Airlines. For example, the airline services provided by Delta Air Lines and American Airlines. There are still many other ways of transportation like coaches and trains. So I will give point 1 to the price range of competing.</p>
<p>Demand variability is a measure of how much variability there is in customer demand. We assume that the demand variability is relatively large because of the availability of substitutes and the low degree of necessities. I will give point 2 to demand variability.</p>
<p>Price elasticity of demand (PED) measures the responsiveness of the quantity demanded for a product when the price changes. The formula is: <img src="file:////private/var/folders/3m/7sxnlpn14sz61bcsw60fqsw80000gn/T/com.kingsoft.wpsoffice.mac/wps-user/ksohtml/wpslNIP3A.jpg" alt="img">. We can not obtain accurate data about PED, but we can estimate it. We assume that during COVID-19, the demand for airline services did not change while their supply decreased due to travel restrictions. Quantity demanded for them decreased as well. At the same time, the revenue dropped. So the demand for them may be price elastic. There are several other indicators. For example, close substitutes are available, including the train and ship. However, it is likely to take up a high proportion of people’s incomes. So I will give point 2 to price elasticity of demand. </p>
<p>The rate of inflation, which is an increase in general price level and a decrease in purchasing power, has many indicators, including Consumer Price Index and Wholesale Price Index. The inflation rate was 1.81% in 2019, 1.25% in 2020, and was predicted to be 2.26% in 2021 (Statista, 2021). These rates are not high inflation rates, as FED set the inflation target at 2% (FED, 2021). I will give point 3 to the rate of inflation. </p>
<p>When discussing the aviation industry, the barriers to entry into the market are relatively high because this industry is capital-intensive. It requires the investors to buy huge capital goods, including aircraft, which need a considerable amount of money. It is defined as an oligopoly by FED because mergers between 2005 and 2015 decreased the number of airline companies significantly. After that, four airlines controlled 80 per cent of the US market in 2015 (Mutzabaugh, 2015). Additionally, the competition for airport gates and significant economies of scale increase the barriers (FED, 2018). So I will give point 5 to barriers to entry.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the average point for environmental stability is approximately 2.14.</p>
<p>Then, we will discuss industry strength. It includes many indicators like growth potential, profit potential, financial stability, technological know-how, resource utilisation, capital intensity, ease of entry into the market, productivity or capacity utilisation, and flexibility or adaptability (Radder, 1998).</p>
<p>Capital intensity is one of the indicators of barriers to entry mentioned above. The aviation industry is capital intensive because of the high demand for aircraft to transport people and products. As this industry is capital intensive, I will give it point 1 for capital intensity.</p>
<p>A stable financial system can provide vital services to households and businesses in good times and bad (Bank of England, 2019). Because of COVID-19, it is hard for United Airlines to control its revenue, expenditure and cash flow. Also, the cash flow performed poorly in 2020. So I will give it point 1.</p>
<p>Productivity utilisation is the extent to which a firm or nation employee its installed productive capacity. As we can find from the annual report (United Airlines, 2021), the number of passengers and available seat miles, the number of seats available for passengers multiplied by the number of scheduled miles those seats flown, can be used.  </p>

<p>Table. 5. Capacity </p>
<p>Source: UAL. “2020 Annual Report.” <strong>United Airlines</strong>, 1 Mar. 2021, <a href="https://ir.united.com/static-files/a30cf7ec-7b4a-4fd9-9ae3-2656e9d53f24">https://ir.united.com/static-files/a30cf7ec-7b4a-4fd9-9ae3-2656e9d53f24</a>.</p>
<p>The number of passengers increased before 2019. However, in 2020, it declined dramatically, remaining only one-third compared with 2019.  The available seat miles has the same trend. In 2020, it fell from 284,999 million to only 122,804 million. Also, the annual report mentioned that the Company cut, relative to 2019 capacity, approximately 57% of its scheduled capacity for 2020 (United Airlines, 2021). So I will give point 1 for productivity utilisation. </p>
<p>The profit potential is the potential for a product to generate revenue which, after expenses, leads to net income. As we are considering the profitability of United Airlines in the near future, the travel restrictions may not be loosened in the short run due to the continuous COVID-19 pandemic. It may keep negative profitability in 2021, similar to 2020, which is mentioned above. So I will give it point 2.</p>
<p>Technological know-how is the set of knowledge and skills that participants have developed and used to guide the acquisition, creation and operation of computer-based systems that enable or facilitate the performance of business processes (Hartono, 2011). As the aviation industry has exactly simple technology, I will give it point 2. </p>
<p>The flexibility of United Airlines is hard to get. However, the civil aviation industry is a member of the tertiary sector, which means it mainly provides customers with services instead of goods. Services can be customised. Meanwhile, the unique point of the aviation industry is that although it is in the tertiary sector, it is still a capital-intensive industry. Sometimes it is hard for them to respond to customers’ wants. For example, the company can not create a new airline in the short term. So I will give point 3 for it. </p>
<p>Growth potential is the future ability of an organisation to gain higher profits, expand the workforce and increase output (Lebeaux, 2012). United Airlines booked up to 25 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft in 2021 (United Airlines, 2021). It is highly possible to grow in the future because of the higher productive potential caused by more capital goods. I will give it point 4. </p>
<p>Resource utilisation means the extent of the use of the resources, which is hard to measure. However, we estimate that as United Airlines is capital intensive, it is highly possible to use its capital resources thoroughly. It is relatively efficient. So I will give it point 5. </p>
<p>It is not easy for investors to enter into aviation market. As mentioned above, it has high start-up costs to purchase capital goods, including aircraft, which increase the barriers to enter the market significantly. So I will give it point 5 for the ease of entry into the market. </p>
<p>In conclusion, the overall mark for industry strength is approximately 2.667.</p>
<p>Then I will talk about Competitive advantage. It includes indicators like market share, product quality, product life cycle, product replacement cycle, customer loyalty, competition’s capacity, technological know-how and vertical integration (Radder, 1998).</p>
<p>As United Airlines is in the tertiary sector, vertical integration means it merges with the providers of the raw materials. However, it seems that United Airlines is fond of  horizontal integration. So I will give it point 2.</p>
<p>Technological know-how is mentioned above. The point is 2. </p>
<p>The product replacement cycle is the time between the purchase of an asset and its replacement with an equivalent asset. </p>

<p>Table. 6. Product replacement cycle </p>
<p>Source: UAL. “2020 Annual Report.” <strong>United Airlines</strong>, 1 Mar. 2021, <a href="https://ir.united.com/static-files/a30cf7ec-7b4a-4fd9-9ae3-2656e9d53f24">https://ir.united.com/static-files/a30cf7ec-7b4a-4fd9-9ae3-2656e9d53f24</a>.</p>
<p>Most of the assets have a relative long product replacement cycle. I will give point 3. </p>
<p>In 2020, Southwest had the largest market share at 19.78% in the domestic market, while Delta Air Lines had the second-largest market share at 14.37%. America Airlines and United Airlines followed the previous two at 16.83% and 8.92%, respectively. It is the fourth-largest airline company in the US. I will give it point 4 in market share. </p>
<p>It seems that product quality is hard to measure because it is the personal feeling about the services provided by United Airlines. However, there is still statistic on the consumers’ feelings of the product quality of United Airlines. It is approximately 3.3 out of 5 points (Comparably, 2021), while American Airlines has 3.6 and British Airways has 3.6. I will give point 4 on the product quality. </p>
<p>Competition’s capacity is more about the degree of competition in the industry. As the number of airline companies is relatively low in both the USA and the world market, we consider the aviation industry as an oligopoly market. I will give point 4 because the level of competition is relatively high. </p>
<p>The product life cycle is relatively long. Also, it has not been changed for years and is predicted to remain in the future because of a lack of substitutes and a high degree of necessity. So the point is 4.</p>
<p>It is noticeable that United Airlines has a unique program called MileagePlus designed to accumulate the miles consumers travel to increase customer loyalty (United Airlines, 2021). This program produced $1.8 billion in earnings last year before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation. It also said that the program had more than 100 million members. I will give point 6 to customer loyalty. </p>
<p>The overall grade for competitive advantage is 3.375.</p>
<p>Finally, we will look at the financial strength. It contains many indicators, including the return on investment, leverage, liquidity, capital required, cash flow, ease of exit from the market and risk involved in the business. </p>
<p>Capital available is another important indicator. As United Airlines operates in the aviation industry, it is capital intensive. So the point for it is 1.</p>
<p>When looking at ease of exit from the market, the critical point is the barriers to exit. It may be hard for United Airlines to leave the market because it owns many capital goods, including aircraft. Also, it has much debt owed to investors, so United Airlines may not be able to find a buyer to buy all the aircraft and repay the debts. Meanwhile, the depreciation of the aircraft may make it challenging to repay the debts even they find a buyer. I will give point 1 on ease of exit from the market. </p>
<p>As we mentioned above, when looking at the cash flow statement of United Airlines, we found that it performed very bad in 2020. The free cash flow was negative. This trend may continue in the future years because of COVID-19 and low net income. I will give it point 1.</p>
<p>The leverage is in bad condition.</p>

<p>We can see that the leverage ratio is keeping rising since March 2020. It is imbalanced. So I will give it point 2. </p>
<p>The annual report of United Airlines by the end of 2020 mentioned the risks involved in the business. There are some risks that COVID-19 caused. These risks did not appear before the outbreak. As human beings still suffer from COVID-19, these risks may last long until scientists develop an effective vaccine and most people get vaccinated. Also, we can not avoid risks such as reliance on technology and third-party providers (United Airlines, 2021) because the business is still running. Compared with the risks that appeared before COVID-19, I will give point 2 to risk involved in business to represent the increasing risks. </p>
<p>Liquidity can be concluded from the cash flow table, especially the free cash flow. It shows that United Airlines has imbalanced liquidity, so I will give it point 2. </p>
<p>We use return on investment to evaluate how well an investment has performed </p>

<p>We can see from the Charts that the ROI decreased from the end of 2019 to December 2020. Luckily, it shows an increasing trend after that. So I will give it point 3.</p>
<p>The overall grade for financial strength is approximately 1.857.</p>
<p>Using the SPACE matrix, we find that United Airlines may take defensive actions. It needs to keep its costs low and decrease the investment. Although based on the theory, it should leave the industry. However, as the whole economy suffers from the recession caused by the pandemic of COVID-19, we still suggest they remain in the industry, waiting for recovery. </p>

<p><strong>Group: Salt fish</strong></p>
<p><strong>Members: Sylvia Dai; Yuki Yang; Tiffany Li; Vivian Yan.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Date: Thursday, June 24, 2021</strong></p>
<p><strong>Acknowledgement</strong></p>
<p>We would like to express our special thanks of gratitude to our teachers Mr. Abass, Ms. Brenda, Ms. Cindy, Ms. Dora and Mr. Paul who provided us with help during the process of completing the project Walk Without Wall, as well as our school Nanjing Foreign Language School International Centre who gave us the this opportunity to do this wonderful project.</p>
<p><strong>Brief Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Our group choose to compare, to what extent, the advantages and disadvantages of rubbish landfill and incineration in Nanjing using data provided and under ideal condition. The treatment of rubbish is an important issue in the city governance. In Nanjing, landfill and incineration are the main two ways of treating the wastes, with no less than two waste incineration plants and three landfills. We will pay our attention to the Jiangnan Waste Incineration Plants run by China Everbright Environment Group Limited Nanjing Branch Office.</p>
<p>In order to compare the advantages and disadvantages from an economic point of view, we will calculate their costs and benefits respectively and discuss their influence on the environment in a non-database way. </p>
<p><strong>Discussion about Landfill</strong></p>
<p>Landfill is the oldest and most common form of rubbish disposal. Although the systematic burial of the waste with daily, intermediate and final covers began in the 1940s, it is still the most popular one. For example, in 2018, 50% of the municipal solid wastes in the U.S.A. were landfilled and 38.5% of wastes were landfilled in the EU. </p>
<p>In Nanjing, more than 8000ton of rubbish is produced everyday. Based on the common sense, landfilling one ton of rubbish needs one cubic meter of the land, so the land required everyday is </p>
<p>8000ton × 1m3/ton = 8000m3</p>
<p>*Before being landfilled, the rubbish needs to be treated before. Unfortunately, we do not get information about its price. </p>
<p>Also, the landfilled rubbish also has other negative influences, including releasing the gases and leachate and the problem of vectors and other nuisances. </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Releasing gases</p>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>Landfill gas is a mix of different gases created by the action of microorganisms within a landfill as they decompose organic waste, including for example, food waste and paper waste. Landfill gas is approximately forty to sixty percent methane, with the remainder being mostly carbon dioxide. As they are green house gases, this may increase the temperature of the Earth. </li>
<li>No data available about the total quantity of gas released by one tonne of rubbish.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Releasing leachate</p>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>A leachate is any liquid that, in the course of passing through matter, extracts soluble or suspended solids, or any other component of the material through which it has passed. In the narrow environmental context leachate is therefore any liquid material that drains from land or stockpiled material and contains significantly elevated concentrations of undesirable material derived from the material that it has passed through.</li>
<li>No data available about the quantity of leachate released by one tonne of rubbish.</li>
<li>It is usually treated with special purifying system in order to reuse them in the industrial production to save water</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Problem of vectors</p>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>Poorly run landfills may become nuisances because of vectors such as rats and flies which can spread infectious diseases. The occurrence of such vectors can be mitigated through the use of daily cover.</li>
<li>No data available about the quantity of vectors caused by one tonne of rubbish.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Other nuisances </p>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>Other potential issues include wildlife disruption due to occupation of habitat and animal health disruption caused by consuming waste from landfills, dust, odor, noise pollution, and reduced local property values.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The analysis above discuss the negative sides of the rubbish landfill, which can be recognised as the external costs and costs of landfill. However, as some of the external costs are hard to measure in terms of the money. As a result, we will not do further calculation.</p>
<p>In the following part, the benefits of the landfill will be discussed.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Excellent energy resource</p>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>As we mentioned above, landfill will release gas including carbon dioxide and methane. In the ideal condition, these gases can be collected, filtered out, and used for energy production. </li>
<li>No data available about the total quantity of gas released by one tonne of rubbish.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Eco-friendly</p>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>If the city chooses to use the modern landfills, it is eco-friendly. Older landfills were just open-air dump for nearly everything but it isn’t the case anymore. Technology is well utilized in the landfills’ design; good soil lining and leachate management system ensures no seepage and damage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Keep cities, towns and districts clean</p>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>Any city that doesn’t have a landfill, they would simply dump waste in the vacant spots. This is unhealthy for humans and the environment. With properly maintained landfill facilities, local trash will be dealt with locally instead of shifting them to other countries.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Keep hazardous waste segregated</p>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>Landfills provide a place to dump recyclable and non-recyclable waste separately. Also, they provide a place to keep more hazardous materials that need to be segregated from the public.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Cheap</p>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>The costs only includes the costs of transportation, pre-disposal, labour and lands.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Discussion about incineration</strong></p>
<p>Incineration is a waste treatment process that involves the combustion of organic substances contained in waste materials. Industrial plants for waste incineration are commonly referred to as waste-to-energy facilities. The energy is usually transferred from chemical energy into electrical energy through a.c. generator. </p>
<p>The plant we discuss is the Jiangnan Waste Incineration Plants run by China Everbright Environment Group Limited Nanjing Branch Office. </p>
<p>Fixed costs are associated with the capital investment in the first year of the proposed incinerator, including three categories of costs: land acquisition costs, equipment and technology acquisition costs and construction and installation costs. We found the percentage of the three categories of costs of Guanghan, Tianjin, China. The table below shows its total costs and percentage. As it is the similar kind of incinerator, the percentage may be similar as well. </p>

</tbody></table>
<p>The total investment on the plants is 205million yuan, which is its total fixed costs. Using the figure provided. </p>
<p>The incinerator land acquisition is</p>
<p>205million × 1% = 20.5million</p>
<p>The incinerator equipment and technology acquisition is</p>
<p>205million × 70% = 143.5million</p>
<p>The incinerator construction and installation costs is </p>
<p>205million × 29% = 59.45million</p>
<p>The variable costs are the costs increase while the output increases. In this case, it mainly includes the collection costs from source to landfill, incinerator maintenance costs and incinerator operational costs. We found the way of calculation for the three costs respectively from an essay written by a Chinese student called Jiao Tang who was having his or her master degree in Vienna in 2012. We will show them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Collection costs from source to landfill</li>
</ul>
<p>We assume that the metals are not separated from the rest waste and also because the incinerator is within 1km distance to the current landfill. Additionally, based on the assumption that the distance between the incinerator and the landfill is 1km, the costs of collecting and transporting the residual bottom ash from the incinerator to the landfill is accounted for. The increased collection costs from source to landfill every year is therefore calculated as </p>
<p>Cc = (QwfII ‐ QwfI) × Pc1 + Qwl × Dl × Pc2  </p>
<p>Where Cc is the total increased collection costs from source to landfill, QwfII the quantity of waste flow from source to the incineration plant in Scenario II, QwfI the quantity of waste flow from source to the landfill inScenario I, Pc1 the unit costs of collection per ton of waste from source to the incineration plant, Qwl the quantity of residual bottom ash that is sent to the landfill, Dl the distance between the incinerator and the landfill and Pc2 the unit costs of collection per ton per km of bottom ash from the incinerator to the landfill. </p>
<p>The unit cost per ton of waste from source to the incineration plant is obtained from a study done for the city of Shenzhen on municipal solid waste collection cost (Li and Kong, 2011), while the unit cost per ton of waste per km is obtained from a study done for the municipality of Heping in the city of Tianjin (Research Office of Tianjing City Heping Municipal People’s Government, 2007). Furthermore, the price of collection cost increases every year by 6.17% per annum, calculated as:</p>
<p>Rcr = rdn × pd/c + rwn × pw/c </p>
<p>where Rcr is the rate of collection costs increase per year, rdn the rate of diesel price increase per year, pd/c the percentage of diesel costs as a component of collection costs, rwn the rate of wage increase per year, and pw/c the percentage of wage costs as a component of collection costs. </p>
<ul>
<li>Incinerator maintenance cocsts</li>
</ul>
<p>Incinerator maintenance costs are the costs of maintaining and repairing the equipment at the incineration plant. According to a study on waste incineration enterprise information system (Anon, 2011), the annual costs of maintenance is approximately 3% of capital investment on the equipment. </p>
<p>3% × 205million = 6.15million</p>
<ul>
<li>Incinerator operational costs</li>
</ul>
<p>The yearly operational costs of the incineration plant includes utility cost (water, electricity, gas), human resource costs, costs of chemical materials needed for air pollution control, costs of auxiliary fuel when needed, costs of materials for amenity and office maintenance, the other administrative costs, excluding equipment maintenance costs. The operational costs every year are calculated as:</p>
<p>Co = Qwi × Po</p>
<p>Where Co is the operational costs, Qwi the waste input into the incinerator, and Po the unit costs of operation. </p>
<p>As it is impossible for us to calculate the latter two costs clearly, so the total costs can not be calculated. However, the calculation above may not be accurate out of the consideration of outmoded, floating exchange rate and inflation over the 10-year period.</p>
<p>Also, the incineration will have some other environmental costs. </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Pollution</p>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>Incinerators produce smoke during the burning process. The smoke produced includes acid gases, carcinogen dioxin, particulates, heavy metals, and nitrogen oxide. These gases are poisonous to the environment. Research has shown that dioxin produced in the plant is a cancer forming chemical.</li>
<li>The quantity of gases produced by the plant can be got online. We can see from the table below. Every furnace produces all kinds of the gases. Although it is far less than the standard, this will still influence the environment.</li>

<li>It is know that one tonne of unrecyclable wastes can produce no less than 476.83 kWh of electricity. So the total quantity of electricity produced everyday is</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>4000t × 476.83kWh/t = 1907320 kWh ≈ 1.91 × 106 kWh</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In money</p>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>It is know that price of the electricity in average is 0.35yuan/kWh*. As a result, the total revenue the plant can gain from electricity everyday is </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>1.91 × 106 kWh × 0.35yuan/kWh = 667562 yuan ≈ 6.7 × 105 yuan</p>
<p>It is also possible to calculate the water produced in terms of the money.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In money</p>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>It is know that the plant creates 2000m3/day of the leachate, most of which is turned into industrial used water. The useful water may be approximately 1800m3/day. The price of the industrial used water is 4.10yuan/m3 in China. As a result, the total revenue the plant can gain from water everyday is</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>1800m3/day × 4.10yuan/m3 = 7380 yuan</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it is said that the slag can be used to produce the bricks which are used for establishing the roads and other infrastructure. Unluckily, we do not have the data about the quantity of the slag is produced everyday. </p>
<p>Still, the incineration has some other benefits as well as those of landfills.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Decrease quantity of wastes</p>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>Incinerators can decrease the quantity of waste by 95% and reduce the solid quantity of the original waste by 80-85% depending on the components that were in solid waste. Hence, even though incinerators do not completely get rid of dumping ground, they definitely decrease the quantity of land needed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Efficient waste management</p>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>Incineration plays a vital role in making waste management easier and more efficient.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Reduction of pollution</p>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>Research has shown that solid waste incinerators are less likely to pollute the environment than landfills. One particular study done during a 1994 lawsuit in the US showed that a waste incinerator location was more environment-friendly compared to a landfill. It will reduce both air pollution and water pollution.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Filters for trapping pollutants</p>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>The main problem concerning the incineration of solid waste was the release of hazardous compounds, particularly dioxin. Nonetheless, up to date incinerator plants use filters to trap hazardous gases and particulate dioxin.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Better control over odor and noise</p>
</li>
<li><p>Prevents the production of methane</p>
</li>
<li><p>Eliminate the harmful germs and chemicals</p>
</li>
<li><p>Not being influenced by the weather</p>
</li>
<li><p>Available computerised monitoring system</p>
</li>
<li><p>Occupy relative small area</p>

<p>It is obvious that the landfill has much more costs than incineration and much fewer benefits. However, nowadays, many cities and countries still choose to use landfill instead of using incineration due to a lack of technology and spare money. Choosing incineration may become a future trend in the field of rubbish treatment. Still, the other new methods such as biodegrading will be developed in the near future which can make the treatment be more efficient, economical and eco-friendly. </p>
<p>In an essay written by a professor from South Korea mentions that among four kinds of treatment methods, including incineration, RPF boiler, RPF furnace and cement furnace, the incineration has the lowest total costs. The government and company may consider in this way during choosing the way of disposal of rubbish.</p>

<li><p>Effect of littering</p>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li><p>Definition: Littering is the improper disposal of waste products. Littering can happen intentionally or unintentionally, but both have environmental consequences.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Negative consequences</p>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li><p>Pollution</p>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>Water&amp;Soil: chemicals and micro-particles are release which make their way into the soil and freshwater sources, impacting both humans and animals</li>
<li>Air: more than 40% of the world’s litter is burned in the open air, which can release toxic emission, causing respiratory issues (impacting humans and animals), other health problems and being a starting base for acid rain</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Kill wildlife</p>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>Over one million animals die each year after ingesting or becoming entrapped in improperly discarded trash</li>
<li>Plastic litter is the most common killer and marine animals are the most notably affected. Each year over 100,000 dolphins, fish, whales, turtles and more drown after becoming entangled in or digesting plastic litter</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Facilitates the spread of disease</p>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li><p>Improperly discarded trash is a breeding ground for bacteria and diseases. Litter can spread diseases, viruses and parasites through direct and indirect contact</p>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>Direct contact: By picking up, touching or by accidentally injuring themselves on improperly disposed of trash</li>
<li>Indirect contact: Bacteria and parasites can be transmitted through affected vectors which are animals or insects that come in contact with contaminated litter and then transmit those contaminates to humans</li>

</li>
<li><p>Personal debt is a total stock of money borrowed and yet to be repaid by a person or a household</p>
</li>
<li><p>Factors affecting</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Availability of loans and overdrafts</p>

<li><p>Reasons for working</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Wage factors</p>
<ul>

</li>
<li><p>Wages</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Piece-rate wage</p>
<ul>
<li>It is a fixed amount paid per item produced or sold–variable costs of firms</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Time-rate wage</p>
<ul>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Bonus</p>
<ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Overtime pay</p>
<ul>
<li>It is an additional payment to the workers who work in excess of the standard working hours—variable costs of firms</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Non-wage factors</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Job satisfaction</p>
<ul>
<li>Some jobs can provide a high degree of job satisfaction. eg. teachers, nurses</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Type of work</p>
<ul>
<li>Most people would rather do non-manual than manual work(Less tiring and more mental stimulation; a high status and better paid)</li>
<li>Prefer to work in a safe environment</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Working conditions</p>
<ul>
<li>People like to work in pleasant surroundings, with friendly colleagues and enjoying regular breaks</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Pensions</p>
<ul>
<li>Considerable variation in the provision of occupational pension</li>
<li>Workers in the public sector receive more generous pensions than those in private sector</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Fringe benefits</p>
<ul>
<li>It is the extra benefit provided to workers by their employers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Job security</p>
<ul>
<li>A high degree of job security means that workers are unlikely to be made redundant</li>
<li>Civil servants often have a high degree of job security, but casual workers have little job security and can be dismissed at short notice</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Career prospects</p>
<ul>
<li>People are prepared to accept low wages at the start of their careers, if they think there is a good possibility that they will gain promotion to a well-paid and interesting post</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Size of firms</p>
<ul>
<li>People are often attracted to jobs in large firms and organisations as they provide more wages and better career prospects, job security and fringe benefits</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Location</p>
<ul>
<li>People may choose an occupation which is close to their home to save money and time</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Working hours</p>
<ul>
<li>Occupations vary in terms of the number of hours expected from workers and the timing of those hours.(Managers and senior officials tend to work for longer hours than shop workers)</li>
<li>Some occupations provide workers with opportunity to work part-time</li>
<li>Some occupations work unsociable hours including work at nights and in the evenings (night shifts and three eight-hour shifts)</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

</li>
<li><p>Occupational choice and opportunity cost</p>
<ul>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Wage determinant</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Labour demand</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The demand for labour refers to the number of workers that firms are willing and able to employ at a given wage rate. Demand for labour is a derived demand(demand for the goods and services it produced, not for itself)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Determination factors</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Price for which that output can be sold</p>
</li>
<li><p>Labour productivity</p>
<ul>
<li>The demand for workers increases as their productivity increases, as higher productivity increases the return from hiring workers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Demand for the product</p>
<ul>
<li>As the demand for labour is a derived demand. The demand for the goods and services increases, so the demand for labour to produce them will increase</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Costs of other factors of production</p>
<ul>
<li>An increase in the price of capital may increase the demand for workers as it is possible to substitute labour for capital</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Labour supply</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The supply for the labour in an economy consists of people who are of working age and who are both willing and able to work at different wage rates.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Determinantion factors</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Number of labour force</p>
<ul>
<li>A fall in labour force will make an individual business more difficult to recruit workers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Qualifications or length of training required to do the job</p>
<ul>
<li>An increase in requirement for qualifications will make the supply of the labour low as the number of people with the willingness and ability to undertake a long period of challenging training is low</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Non-wage benefits of the job</p>
<ul>
<li>A decrease in non-wage benefits may reduce people’s willingness to do it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Wage or non-wage benefits in other jobs</p>
<ul>
<li>A rise in the benefits in other jobs will encourage some workers to switch from one occupation to another</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Relative bargaining power of employment workers</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Wages are likely to be higher in occupations where workers have strong bargaining power</p>
</li>
<li><p>Trade unions</p>
<ul>
<li>Trade union will use their bargaining strength to negotiate on behalf of their members. A change in trade union’s bargaining power and willingness to take industrial action can affect</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Level of education</p>
<ul>
<li>A higher level of education will increase the worker’s bargaining power</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Age and experience</p>
<ul>
<li>An increase in age and experience can increase the worker’s bargaining power and its higher wages.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Government policies</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Clearly influences the wages of those workers whom it employs in the public sector</p>
</li>
<li><p>Specific government policies may have an impact on particular occupations</p>
</li>
<li><p>Directly affect wages–National Minimum Wage</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Results</p>
<ul>
<li>If the government introduces an NMW which is above the equilibrium wage, the quantity supplied will extend and the quantity demanded will contract. A surplus of labour appears and results in unemployment</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Consequences</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Advantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Workers have a fair or liveable wages and are not exploited by the employers</li>
<li>Create incentive for the unemployed to work</li>
<li>Low income earners have more money to spend and increase consumption and ease the fears higher wages will cause unemployment</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Disadvantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Workers who earn more than NMW may ask for a higher wage to maintain the wage differential</li>
<li>Unemployment may increase as an increase in costs of labour make firms to purchase more capital goods</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Public opinion</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider that jobs which involve long periods of study and training should be highly rewarded</li>
<li>Influence the wages claims made by the workers</li>
<li>Put pressure on a government to revise the wages it pays to the public sector workers</li>
<li>Attitudes towards women. If social attitudes are against working women, it is harder for women to find employment and may receive significantly less pay than male counterparts</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Discrimination</p>
<ul>
<li>It occurs when a group of workers is treated unfavourable in terms of employment, the wage rate, the training received and promotional opportunities</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Stages of production</p>
<ul>
<li><p>People work in primary sector may usually less well-paid than those who work in secondary and tertiary sectors.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Reasons</p>
<ul>
<li>Workers in primary sector tend to be less skilled and have fewer qualifications</li>
<li>With the development of the economy, the demand for primary sector workers usually declines</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Earnings of individuals over time</p>
<ul>
<li>The longer people work, the more skilled and productive they tend to become. An increase in productivity is caused by gaining experience and undertake training</li>
<li>Some older workers may decide to give up working overtime and some may switch to less demanding work, so the wages and bonuses reduces</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Extent to which earnings change</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Determinant of elasticity of demand for labour</p>
<ul>
<li>Proportion of labour costs in total costs</li>
<li>Ease with which labour can be substituted by capital</li>
<li>Elasticity of demand for the product produced</li>
<li>Time period</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Determinant of elasticity of supply of labour</p>
<ul>
<li>Qualifications and skills required</li>
<li>Length of training period</li>
<li>Level of employment</li>
<li>Mobility of labour</li>
<li>Degree of vacation</li>
<li>Time period</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Division and specialisation of labour</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Specialization</p>
<ul>
<li>It occurs when a worker become an experts in a particular profession</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Division</p>
<ul>
<li>It occurs when a production process or task is split between different workers who become experts in a part of the process</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Consequences</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Advantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Workers become experts in their field, so the productivity and efficiency increases. The average costs of production decreases</li>
<li>Quality of the products or services increases</li>
<li>Workers become more skilled so their earning potential increases</li>
<li>Create higher motivation, productivity, output and competitiveness for the firms</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Disadvantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Workers may get bored, make more mistakes and decrease productivity</li>
<li>Workers may become alienated</li>
<li>Become too dependent on an individual workers and be hard to cover for the workers who are off sick or under training</li>
<li>Workers become deskilled in other areas and results in a lack of occupational immobility</li>

<li>Enjoy economies of scale. This means they can have low average costs of production and have  international competitiveness against foreign competitiors</li>
<li>Have financial resources to invest in innovation. Research and development expenditure can help to generate new ideas, products and production processes. Innovation can act as a source of profit and improve productive capacity</li>
<li>Eliminate wasteful competition. This is because profit-seeking firms may not have much of a financial incentive to provide services in remote areas of the country and a single provider can gain huge economies of scale. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Disadvantages</p>
<ul>
<li>No substitutes. The demand is price inelastic so they can charge higher prices due to price makers to maximise profits</li>
<li>High barriers may prevent new firms. This limits the degree of competition and ensure monopolists continue to charge high prices</li>
<li>Less incentive to innovate. Because of a lack of competitive pressure, they may become complacent rather than focusing on innovations</li>
<li>Market failure. This will result in an inefficient allocation of resources</li>

<li>At the beginning of a business, their initial objective may be survival</li>
<li>During difficult times when demand is falling, large firms may have survival as objectives</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Growth</p>
<ul>
<li>An increase in size may bring advantages like economies of scale</li>
<li>Those who run firms may want the growth as their pay and status may be closely linked to the size of the firm and increase gob security</li>
<li>If growth is achieved by merging, competition will be reduced and the company may gain a larger market share</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Social welfare</p>
<ul>
<li>Public sector companies may aim at improving social welfare through charging relative low prices to ensure they are affordable. Also, they may get to understand the externalities</li>

<ul>
<li>Make enough dividends to keep shareholders happy while pursuing other objectives</li>

</li>
<li><p>Profit maximisation</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Other objectives may conflict with this, but pursuit of them may actually increase profits in the long run.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Formula: profit=revenue-cost; It is maximised when the gap between total revenue and total costs is the highest</p>

<li>Provide firms with more finance to update their capital equipment and expand their business</li>
<li>Make it easier to obtain external finance</li>
<li>Easier to recruit top managers and directors, attracted by their success</li>
<li>A fall in profit may have little impact on the behaviour of firms in the short run. But in the long run, firms may cut back on production and cease production</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Ways of increasing profit</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Reduce costs of production</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce any wastages and inefficiency</li>

<li><p>Cyclical unemployment</p>
<ul>
<li>Definition: It is prolonged and widespread unemployment during an economic recession due to falling and depressed aggregate demand</li>
<li>It is more serious than structural unemployment as potentially it can affect more workers and it is spread throughout the country</li>

</li>
<li><p>Causes</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Cost-push inflation</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It occurs when the price level is pushed up by increases in the costs of production. As costs are higher, producers will raise their prices to maintain their profit margins</p>
</li>
<li><p>Reasons</p>
<ul>
<li>Wages increase more than labour productivity</li>
<li>Increase in the cost of raw materials</li>

<li>Stability of this rate</li>
<li>Rate relative to the inflation rates in other countries</li>
<li>Reaction of the government</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Advantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Encourage firms to expand</li>
<li>Reduce the real burden of any debt</li>
<li>Prevent some workers being made redundant in a declining industry or region as they may accept their wages rising by less than inflation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Disadvantages</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Producer</p>
<ul>
<li>Menu costs are costs involved in changing prices in catalogues, price lists and slot machines</li>
<li>Shoe leather costs arise because money paid to firms will be losing its value as son as it is received. Seeking out good financial returns will involve the time and effort of firms</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>A fall in the value of money. There will be a fall in the real income and purchasing power.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Redistribute income in an unplanned way</p>
<ul>
<li>Savers will lose out from inflation because the money they saved is worth less than before. Also, this discourages saving and reduce bond which results in lower investment</li>
<li>Borrowers gain from inflation as the money they need to repay is worth less than when they initially borrowed it</li>
<li>Lenders will lose out from inflation because the money they lent out to borrowers becomes worth less than before</li>
<li>Fixed income earners and pensioners will have a fall in their real income</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Uncertainty. It makes it harder to judge right prices and plan ahead. Firms may be discouraged from investment</p>
</li>
<li><p>Harm balance of payment. If the country’s inflation rate is above that of its rivals, its products will become less price competitive so export will fall and import will increase. Unemployment may appear meanwhile</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fiscal drag. When government don’t adjust tax brackets in line with inflation, so people’s incomes are dragged into higher tax brackets and they are left with lower real disposable income</p>

</li>
<li><p>Harmful</p>
<ul>
<li>A decline in AD. Consumers may expect prices to be lower so they may decrease purchase and output will decrease. Unemployment may increase.</li>

<li><p>Principles</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Equity</p>
<ul>
<li>Fairness in the sense that the amount of tax people and firms have to pay should be based on their ability to pay</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Certainty</p>
<ul>
<li>A tax should be easy to understand and it is available for individuals to calculate tax</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Convenience</p>
<ul>
<li>A tax should be easy to pay</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Economy</p>
<ul>
<li>The costs of collecting should be less than tax revenue</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Flexibility</p>
<ul>
<li>It should be easy to change the tax if economic activity changes and government aims change</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Efficiency</p>
<ul>
<li>It should improve the performance of markets or at least not reduce the efficiency</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Impact</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Tax base and tax burden</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Tax base</p>
<ul>
<li>A large tax base means that a large range of items and people are taxed</li>
<li>A high tax rate may decrease tax base</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Tax burden</p>
<ul>
<li>It is related to the amount of tax paid by people and firms</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Taxation</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Elasticity</p>
<ul>
<li><p>PED</p>
<ul>
<li>If the demand is more price inelastic, consumers bear most tax</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>PES</p>
<ul>
<li>If the supply is more price inelastic, the more tax will be borne by the suppliers</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Price and quantity</p>
<ul>
<li>A sales tax will shift the supply cure to the left due to higher costs of production. This increase the prices and reduce quantity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Economic growth</p>
<ul>
<li>Tax may discourage workers to work.</li>
<li>A cut in tax can encourage domestic spending which benefits consumers, businesses and economy</li>
<li>Tax revenue helps government spending and makes contribution to economic growth</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Inflation</p>
<ul>
<li>Tax will decrease people’s real income and firms’ profits. It may reduce inflation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Business location</p>
<ul>
<li>The tax rate of direct tax will affect MNCs locations</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Social behavior</p>
<ul>
<li>Taxation can be used to alter social behaviour by reducing the consumption of demerit goods. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Distribution of income</p>
<ul>
<li>Taxes can be used to help redistribute income and wealth from the relatively rich to the poorer members of society. </li>

<li><p>Income</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The higher the real GDP per head, the greater economic development tends to be.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Problems</p>
<ul>
<li>Inequalities in distribution of income</li>
<li>Composition of GDP should be considered</li>
<li>Economic growth can bring about problems, so other factors should also be considered</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Productivity</p>
<ul>
<li>Higher productivity will make it easier to develop</li>
<li>Foreign direct investment will increase productivity in quantity and quality of FOPs so increase the productive capacity and competitiveness, create jobs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Population growth</p>
<ul>
<li>countries with high population growth may have a high dependency ratio so government will spend more in education</li>
<li>Rapid population growth can limit any increase in real GDP as it reduces the GDP per capita.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Size of primary, secondary and tertiary sectors</p>
<ul>
<li>As an economy develops, there tends to be a shift away from reliance on primary and secondary sector production towards tertiary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Saving</p>
<ul>
<li>Due to different income, poor people can’t afford to save so the country with low average income may have low savings ratio. This will be a lack of finance for investment</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Investment</p>
<ul>
<li>Countries with low value of capital goods per worker may have low income per head</li>
<li>Countries with low savings may be hard for firms to borrow, so investment may be low and can’t contribute directly to economic development</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Education and healthcare</p>
<ul>
<li>A lack of access to or poor quality of education and healthcare will reduce living standards and low productivity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Concentration on a narrow range of exports</p>
<ul>
<li>Countries that export a narrow range of products can be adversely affected by large decrease in demand or supply</li>

<h3 id="Why-aim-for-economic-development"><a href="#Why-aim-for-economic-development" class="headerlink" title="Why aim for economic development"></a>Why aim for economic development</h3><ul>
<li>Higher real GDP, higher living standards and expansion of the range of economic and social choices</li>
<li>Have potential to raise material living standards</li>
<li>Enjoy more goods and services</li>
<li>Life expectancy may be increased and infant mortality rate may be reduced</li>
<li>Higher living standards</li>
<li>Distribution of income does not become too uneven and poverty is reduced</li>
<li>Expanding the range of economic and social choices, increasing freedom and self-esteem includes increasing access to education, healthcare and participation in the political process. This will improve the quality of lives and enhance future economic performance</li>

<li><p>High growth of population</p>
<ul>
<li>A high birth rate can result in resources being used</li>
<li>In the low run, higher birth rate increases the country’s productive potential and living standards</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>High levels of international debt</p>
<ul>
<li>Opportunity cost of repaying debt may be economic development. As poor countries may borrow heavily, a large percentage of country’s income is taken up in repaying loans</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Reliance on the export of primary products</p>
<ul>
<li>The price of primary products tends to fall so they receive less for exports and pay more for imports.</li>
<li>Consuming and rich countries use their buying power to keep down the prices</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Lack of investment in capitals and humans</p>
<ul>
<li>This may hold back the increases in productivity, introduction of new technology and international competitiveness</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Emigration of key workers</p>
<ul>
<li>Key workers may seek better-paid employment abroad</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Trade restrictions on their products</p>
<ul>
<li>Tariffs make it difficult for developing countries to sell their products at home and abroad.</li>
<li>Tariffs also build up as the goods are processed into higher-value-added goods, so that economies are discouraged from building up their industries</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Unbalanced economies</p>
<ul>
<li>Certain markets may be under-developed such as the financial sector. A lack of developed financial sector is likely to discourage saving and investment</li>

<li><p>Absolute poverty</p>
<ul>
<li>Definition: It occurs when people do not have access to basic food, clothing and shelter</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Relative poverty</p>
<ul>
<li>Definition: It occurs when people are poor relative to other people in the country</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Causes of poverty </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Unemployment</p>
<ul>
<li>The unemployed may be poor due to low literacy, unskilled and illness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Low wages</p>
<ul>
<li>Lower GPD per head, poorer the country tends to be due to the low wages in the economy. Low wages may due to unskilled workers, so they may have low wages, low consumption and investment. These results in poverty.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Illness</p>
<ul>
<li>A lack of healthcare reduce life expectancy in a country. The lower the life expectancy, the poorer the country tends to be and so the greater the degree of poverty in the country. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Low literacy rates</p>
<ul>
<li>This measures the proportion of the population aged 15 and above who can read and write</li>
<li>Low-income country tend to have low literacy rates due to lack of sufficient education. This causes high unemployment and low productivity. It is hard to eradicate poverty.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Growing old</p>
<ul>
<li>People will retire and have low pensions</li>

<li><p>Improve the quantity and quality of education</p>
<ul>
<li>This will increase workers’ productivity, so increase job prospects and earning potential of the poor and their children</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Promote economic growth</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase AD and increase out, so jobs are created. Unemployment decreases as a result</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Introduce or raise a national minimum wage</p>
<ul>
<li>Tackle the problem of people experiencing low living standards due to low wages</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Provide benefits or increase state benefits</p>
<ul>
<li>This can help the elderly, sick and disabled to avoid absolute poverty.</li>
<li>This has both advantages and disadvantages</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Land reform</p>
<ul>

<li><p>Classification of specialisation</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Definition: It occurs when individuals, firms, regions or countries concentrate on the production of a particular good or  service. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Individuals</p>
<ul>
<li>Become more skilled and efficient at their jobs, and increase both quality and quantity of the goods and serviced produced</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Firms</p>
</li>
<li><p>Regions</p>
</li>
<li><p>Countries</p>
<ul>
<li>Definition: International specialisation occurs when countries concentrate on the production of certain goods or services due to cost advantages (cheaper production methods) and their abundance of superior resources. </li>
<li>Influenced by the quantity and quality of their resources</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Advantages of specialisation</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For consumers</p>
<ul>
<li>Enjoy more goods and services and higher living standards as an increase in output</li>
<li>Better quality of the product as an improvement in skills and techniques</li>
<li>Lower price as the average costs of production decrease</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>For firms</p>
<ul>
<li>Take the advantages of economies of scale</li>
<li>Be able to buy raw materials from specialist firms which are producing high quality raw materials at low costs</li>
<li>Trade helps firms in the exchange of new management ideas, information about the new products and new technology</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>For the economy</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase efficiency and economic welfare</li>
<li>Real GDP should be relative high and output would be higher</li>
<li>Consume outside its PPC</li>
<li>Consume more goods and services to raise living standards and reduce relative poverty</li>
<li>Resources will not be lying idle</li>
<li>Keep inflation rate relatively low</li>
<li>Build up reputation in producing particular product to attract more sales and ancillary industries to set up in the country and boost its sales of exports </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Disadvantages of specialisation</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For consumers</p>
<ul>
<li>One or some countries may gain control of most of the global market and restrict supply to push up the price</li>
<li>May not follow the same health and safety standards as the home country</li>
<li>Any problems happened in the country may stop the country from producing so in the short run the product is not available</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>For firms</p>
<ul>
<li>Too dependent on other counties for the markets of the products they produce and for the sources of their raw materials</li>
<li>May experience a fall in demand as tastes may change or foreign counties become more efficient or a substitute may be developed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>For the economy</p>
<ul>
<li>Hard to determine what an economy is best at producing and what will be in demand in the future</li>
<li>If demand suddenly falls or costs rise, the country may run into difficulties and results in structural unemployment</li>
<li>High transport costs may also offset any costs advantage a country has in producing</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Absolute&amp;Comparative advantage</p>
<ul>
<li>Definition: Absolute advantage is a country can produce the product using fewer resources than other countries</li>
<li>Definition: Comparative advantage is a country can produce the product at a lower opportunity costs than other countries</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Trade</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Definition: International trade refers to the exchange of goods and services beyond national borders. It entails the sale of exports (goods and services sold to overseas buyers) and imports (foreign goods and services bought by domestic households and firms).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Definition: Free trade means that international trade can take place without any forms of protection (barriers to international trade), such as quantitative limits or taxes being imposed on exports.</p>
<ul>
<li>Advantages </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Connection between specialisation and international trade</p>
<ul>
<li>Producing a relatively narrow range of products will mean that countries will have to export some of their output. This is necessary for them to gain revenue for spending on imports of products that their citizens want to buy, but their countries are not producing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Globalisation</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Definition: Globalisation is the process by which the world’s economies become increasingly interdependent and interconnected due to greater international trade and cultural exchanges. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Consequences</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Advantages</p>
<ul>
<li>With increasing international trade, creating wealth and jobs throughout the world</li>
<li>Increasing competition results in more products at relatively low prices</li>
<li>Encourage firms to locate their production in most efficient locations</li>
<li>Freer movement of labour, capital, goods and services</li>
<li>Firms can enjoy economies of scale</li>
<li>More choices of goods and services</li>
<li>Greater cultural understanding and appreciation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Disadvantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Greater dependence on global economy(A recession in one economy can have significant impact on other economies)</li>
<li>Some workers may lose their jobs because of increased competition</li>
<li>Increase the importance of occupational mobility</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Multinational company(MNC)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>An MNC in an organisation that operates in two or more countries. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Advantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Foreign country–Through job creation, improve standards of living in the countries</li>
<li>Firms&amp;consumers–MNCs enjoy economies of scale so MNCs can pass on cost savings to their consumers in form of lower prices</li>
<li>Firms&amp;home country–By operating in overseas market, MNCs are able to generate more profits because of an increase in consumer base(profit are repatriated so home country benefits)</li>
<li>Firms&amp;foreign country–MNCs move or expand their operations in foreign countries to benefit from lower rates of corporation tax.</li>
<li>Firms–Spread risks by operating overseas</li>
<li>Firms–Avoid any trade restrictions</li>
<li>Firms–Access new markets by locating overseas and reduce transportation costs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Disadvantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Workers–Unethical and cost-cutting practises</li>
<li>Local companies–MNCs can force local firms that are less competitive to close down because of their huge market power and ability to exploit economies of scale</li>
<li>Local government–They are often in a powerful position to exploit foreign governments over decisions</li>
<li>Local country–Higher unemployment</li>
<li>Local country–Over-reliance on MNCs in low income countries means there are major consequences should an MNC choose to relocate the operation</li>
<li>MNCs– Hard to manage the overall business because of a lack of effective communications</li>
<li>MNCs– Fluctuating exchange rate makes it difficult to measure and compare the value of MNCs’ sales and profits</li>
<li>MNCs– May not provide goods and services appealed to local tastes and consumers</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Protection"><a href="#Protection" class="headerlink" title="Protection"></a>Protection</h3><ul>
<li><p>Definition: Protection refers to the use of trade barriers to restrict foreign trade, thereby limiting overseas competition</p>
</li>
<li><p>Methods</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Tariff</p>
<ul>
<li>It is a tax on imports.</li>
<li>Tariff increases the cost of production and the price of imports in domestic market, so the quantity of imports reduces</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Import quotas</p>
<ul>
<li>It sets a quantitative limit on the scale of a foreign goods in a country.</li>
<li>Quota limits the quantity imported</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Subsidies</p>
<ul>
<li>Government can provide subsidies to domestic firms to compete against importers</li>
<li>Subsidies lower the costs of production for home firms</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Embargo</p>
<ul>
<li>It is a ban on trade with a certain country, due to a trade dispute or political conflict</li>
<li>An embargo rarely benefits local consumers as they suffer from a lack of choices and higher prices</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Exchange control</p>
<ul>
<li>A government try to decrease import through restricting the availability of foreign currency</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Quality standards</p>
<ul>
<li>A country may ask imports to reach artificially high standards results in dissuading other countries from selling or pushing up prices</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Expensive paperwork</p>
<ul>
<li>Require foreign firms to fill out a considerable amount of time-consuming paperwork</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Voluntary export restraints(VERs)</p>
<ul>
<li>A government may persuade the foreign government to agree to restrict the number of units of a product sold by it</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Consequences</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Advantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Help the infant industries from foreign competition and safeguard domestic jobs, because in extreme cases, fierce competition from foreign rivals can even force domestic firms out of business.</li>
<li>Prevent foreign countries dumping(occurs when foreign firms sell their products in large quantities at prices deliberately below those charged by domestic firms, often even below the cost of production)</li>
<li>Increase government revenue</li>
<li>Overcome a balance of payment deficit as restricting imports will help to deal with it</li>
<li>To protect strategic industries instead of relying on foreign countries</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Disadvantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Government intervention may distort market signals and results in an international misallocation of resources. The domestic companies may become too reliant on government and become inefficient</li>
<li>Decreasing competition and incentive for innovation may lead to an increase in price. Costs of raw materials may increase as well and results in imported inflation</li>
<li>Other countries may react with retaliating and imposing their own barriers. This may hinder global economic growth and prosperity</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Exchange-rate"><a href="#Exchange-rate" class="headerlink" title="Exchange rate"></a>Exchange rate</h3><ul>
<li><p>Definition: An exchange rate refers to the price of one currency measured in terms of other currencies. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Determination</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Demand for currency</p>
<ul>
<li>This means that as the value of a country’s currency rises, its demand for imports tends to increase.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Supply of currency</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Floating exchange rate</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Definition: In floating exchange rate, the value of the currency is determined by the market forces of demand for the currency and supply of the currency</p>
</li>
<li><p>Change in exchange rate</p>
<ul>
<li>Definition: An appreciation in the exchange rate if the exchange rate is rising against other currencies</li>
<li>Definition: A depreciation in the exchange rate if the exchange rate is falling against other currencies</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Fixed exchange rate</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Definition: In a fixed exchange rate system, the government intervenes in foreign exchange markets to maintain its exchange rate at a predetermined level</p>
</li>
<li><p>Main advantage: reducing the uncertainties for international trade makes domestic and foreign firms to be certain about future costs and prices and encourages international trade and exchange</p>
</li>
<li><p>This is achieved by the respective government buying and selling foreign currencies</p>
</li>
<li><p>Change in exchange rate</p>
<ul>
<li>Definition: A revaluation in the exchange rate if the exchange rate is rising against other currencies</li>
<li>Definition: A devaluation in the exchange rate if the exchange rate is falling against other currencies</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Causes of exchange rate fluctuations</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Floating exchange rate system</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Changes in demand for exports: An increase in the demand for export will increase the demand for the country’s currency and increase the exchange rate</p>
</li>
<li><p>Changes in demand for imports: An increase in the demand for import will increase the demand for foreign currency and increase the value of foreign currency</p>
</li>
<li><p>Prices and inflation: An increase in the price of goods and services caused by domestic inflation will decrease the demand for exports</p>
</li>
<li><p>Foreign direct investment(FDI): Investment in overseas production plant requires the use of foreign currencies</p>
<ul>
<li>Inward FDI(eg. the entry of an MNC)will boost the demand for a currency</li>
<li>Outward FDI(eg. departure of an MNC)will increase the supply of a currency</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Speculation: foreign exchange traders and investment companies move money around the world to take advantage of higher interest rates and variations in exchange rates to earn a profit. As huge sums of money(hot money)are involved, speculation can cause exchange rate fluctuations. They might lack confidence and therefore withdraw their investment and depreciate the currency</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Fixed exchange rate system</p>
<ul>
<li>Government intervention</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Consequences of appreciation and revaluation</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Advantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Consumers will have greater purchasing power</li>
<li>Importers gain from a strong dollar because the raw materials, components and finished goods will be cheaper. But this is bad for domestic producers</li>
<li>As unemployment decreases, the inflation rate will decrease. Also, if the country relies heavily on imports, the higher exchange rate will reduce general price level</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Disadvantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Exporters may face difficulties as exchange rate increases caused by their goods and services become more expensive for foreign consumers</li>
<li>A fall in net exports and deteriorating profits will cause job losses in export-oriented businesses and increase unemployment</li>
<li>In the long run, as a result of the higher exchange rate, economic growth is likely to fall due to the combination of lower export sales and higher unemployment.</li>
<li>If a currency appreciation has a larger impact on exports than imports (that is, there is a fall in the value of net exports), then the balance of payments will worsen, as a strong currency will make it more difficult for exporters to sell their goods and services in overseas markets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Coping with a strong exchange rate</p>
<ul>
<li>Cutting export prices to maintain their price competitiveness against foreign rivals</li>
<li>Seeking alternative suppliers of cheaper raw materials</li>
<li>Improving productivity to keep costs of production low</li>
<li>Provide more price inelastic demand products as consumers are not sensitive with price change caused by exchange fluctuations</li>
<li>Improving non-price factors, including brand awareness and social responsibility</li>
<li>Relocate the production process overseas</li>
</ul>

<li><p>Deficit</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Definition: A current account deficit occurs when its import expenditure is greater than its export earnings(the current account has a negative balance)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Causes</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Lower demand for exports</p>
<ul>
<li>A decline in manufacturing competitiveness(may caused by higher labour costs domestically)</li>
<li>A decline income in foreign market(may due to a decrease in available money caused by an economic recession)</li>
<li>An increase in exchange rate which makes exports more expensive and reduce the volume and value of exports</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Higher demand for imports</p>
<ul>
<li>Cheaper or better quality of imports(cheaper may due to a decrease in exchange rate)</li>
<li>Domestic inflation which makes imports relatively cheaper</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Consequences</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Advantages</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Lower exchange rate</p>
<ul>
<li>The demand for the domestic currency decreases so the exchange rate decreases and exports become more competitive</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Disadvantages</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Reduced demand</p>
<ul>
<li>As the economy is spending more on imports that it is receiving, the demand in economy will fall and a recession may be triggered</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Unemployment</p>
<ul>
<li>A fall in overall demand may cause cyclical unemployment. Also, the wages may decrease</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Lower standards of living</p>
<ul>
<li>The deficit may be caused by capital outflows exceed capital inflows. The economy may suffer from lower standards of living as income is less. Also, households and firms may need to reduce spending</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Increased borrowing</p>
<ul>
<li>Deficit means spending more than income. Government needs to borrow money to overcome the difference which results in interest and repayment of the loan(any money which government spends has an opportunity cost)</li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Higher incomes in overseas markets</li>
<li>A decrease in exchange rate</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Low demand for imports</p>
<ul>
<li>Imports are more expensive or of a lower quality</li>
<li>Inflation in overseas countries causes import tend to be expensive</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Consequences</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Advantages</p>
<ul>
<li>A fall in unemployment in domestic economy, but an increase in unemployment in other countries</li>
<li>The country receive high income because the home country has a competitive advantage in the product they export and result in a better living standards</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Disadvantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Higher demand for exports may lead to demand-pull inflation and diminish the international competitiveness</li>
<li>Higher demand for exports can cause the currency to appreciate in value and foreign buyers will find it more expensive to import goods into their countries.</li>
