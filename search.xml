    <title>SOME RECORDS ON NEC</title>
    <url>/2020/12/21/AR%202020-12-21NEC/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Last Sunday afternoon, 2020 21st Dec, I finished my NEC exam. </p>
<p>I have prepared for the exam since I decided to take part in it. When the words ‘EXAM IS OVER’ appeared on my screen, I was a little bit disappointed because there were many questions which I found I could not do anything with. </p>
<p>About four months ago, when I talked to my Economics teacher Ms.Cindy, I heard about NEC for the first time. She told me that NEC is National Economics Challenge and advantages and disadvantages of it. I decided to take part in it as I discovered that I am really interested in Economics.</p>
<p>Then, I discussed with my friends. We founded a group called ‘Together Group’ because we hoped that everyone in our group can always be together and support each other during preparation. </p>
<p>At the beginning, we four were all very positive, energetic and active. Tiffany found some lessons online, while Leo borrowed some books like Baron. Yuki and I collected and sorted all the materials we had. We even attended the CCA for NEC every Tuesday afternoon. This was the most impressive part in this activity, as Together Group gave me the feeling of a family.</p>
<p>Gradually, two of us started to lose confidence as other students are stronger than us in Economics. Yuki and I kept on taking classes and reading Mankind’s Principle of Economy. During this stage, I noticed that it became easier for me to understand some knowledge we learn in normal classes by Ms.Cindy.</p>
<p>Before the exam, I knew that it was almost impossible for my Together Group to get into next turn as it counted the top three marks in a group. However, I didn’t choose to give up because for a very long time I have believe that after the winter, there will always be the spring and when I do a thing, especially as a group member, I need to try my best to finish it because it is my responsibility and if I do, I can grow stronger. Several night before the exam, I stayed up late until mid-night and wrote a pile of notes. When collecting them after exam, strong sense of pride and achievement. </p>
<p>I haven’t get the result of the exam. However, I believed that everything will be well although we may not get into next turn to take part in the NEC China Finals, because I have done my best and insisted the belief in my heart for years.</p>
<p>From NEC Preliminary, I got to know that when I decide to do something, it is better for me to finish it without distractions, because when I act as this, I will become stronger and stronger. </p>

    <title>SOME RECORDS ON AMC and AIME</title>
    <url>/2021/04/14/AR%202021-04-14AMC/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>On 5th and 11th February, I finished my two AMC exams.</p>
<p>AMC is American Mathematics Competition. It is one of the most popular and welcomed maths competition all over the world. During primary school, I used to take part in AMC8 and receive a relative high score(Top 2.5%). As a result, after attending senior high school, AMC became one of my after-class activities as well, because I wanted to challenge myself through it. </p>
<p>During my process of preparation, I felt a little bit lonely from time to time, as there were only a few students in my class choosing to try AMC12 which is beyond the current syllabus.</p>
<p>I tried to talk with August who prepared for AMC12 too, about the exam preparing. We discussed questions from time to time after that. Now, we are good friends. This is the most impressive part of the activity. </p>
<p>I started to understand that although we may compete with each other during the competition, it is still important and possible for us to cooperate, as a result of friendship. Competition is more than competing. August and I received satisfied scores. I got 103.5points in AMC10A and 117points in AMC12B. </p>
<p>Additionally, through AMC, one thing has become clearer than before. The process of improving, challenging and studying may be lonely because everyone makes different decision during this period. For example, my best friend Estella chose to forgo AMC as she wanted to take part in FBLA more. Another example is that during the last preparing day, August and I still had a lot of things which we had not learnt and understood. We chose to study different areas.</p>
<p>From my point of view, the aloneness is one of the lessons we need to learn during our studying time. </p>
<p>Fortunately, I got the chance to take part in AIME(America Invitational Mathematics Examination). However, something unexpected happened. The date of AIME was conflicted with my school IGCSE mock examination. I said to myself several time, “Mock is more important as it is the first time for me to experience international examinations hold by CAIE and mock exam will be the source of GPA of this semester.” Every time the sense of not convinced also came to my heart as it really took me hours and hours learning maths knowledge and going through past papers. </p>
<p>Finally, I decided to give up preparing for AIME to save time for mock exams. After handing in my AIME paper, I got to know that this time I must have been failed to achieve anything. It was near 8 p.m. when AIME was done. Block 1912 opposite my school was still full of music sounds and colourful lights. Suddenly, one concept which I learnt in Economics came to my mind——opportunity cost and made me feel relived.</p>
<p>Everyone has limited time and energy, but I always long for finishing everything which is unattainable and impossible. As a result, it is necessary for me to make a decision on what to do. Opportunity cost is the next best choice foregone when making a decision. I still remember the words which were said by my Economics teacher Ms. Cindy when I told her that I would switch my future major from Physics to Economics. She said that, “Every decision or choice has an opportunity cost. I simply hope that you can consider the thing carefully before making a decision.”</p>
<p>Perhaps to Estella, she though FBLA was more important than AMC so she made such a decision that high prize was rewarded to her by FBLA but not so good performance was shown by her in AMC. To me, I still hope to achieve higher marks in IGCSE instead of AIME.</p>
<p>To sum up, I will always remember AMC and AIME of this year. They provides me with a chance to experience the concept of opportunity costs by myself instead of leaving it only as a piece of knowledge in my Economics books. </p>
<p>Meantime, after seeing the lights and hearing the sounds from Block 1912, I am not regretted about my decision anymore, although a total of only 4 marks was achieved by me in AIME, because I still realised that life sucks, so it may be better for me to be cute and enjoy and try to get understand the tastes of life more, instead of giving myself too much press to spend time seeing the around world.</p>

    <title>SOME RECORDS ON Physics Bowl</title>
    <url>/2021/04/15/AR%202021-04-15Physics%20Bowl/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>On 27th March, around two o’clock in the afternoon, I finished 2021 Physics Bowl.</p>
<p>That was a nice afternoon which is windy and cloudy. The paper was not very hard as the Electromagnetism didn’t appear too many times which is my drawback among all pieces of knowledge. The boy sitting on my left, finished his paper very quickly and seemed to be very confident about his answers.</p>
<p>I was a little bit upset that day. Two things were always on my mind.</p>
<p>To be honest, during the long preparation for Physics Bowl, I gave up half way instead of insisting on training past papers and getting through the book after class. I still remembered the first lesson of Physics Bowl taken by me at the beginning of the first semester of Senior1. During that time, Physics was my favourite subject and I even set it as my target major in the university. However, I started to learn more about both Physics and Economics. Economics is a new subject to me which I refused to study before entry of senior high school but was deeply attracted after getting to understand some basic knowledge. By contrast, it was unbelievable that it began hard for me to understand the complicated concepts in Physics which ran out all my patience and interest. With further study in Economics competition, more time was devoted to Economics instead of Physics. It was a process that happened during a long period, but I still remembered clearly some small moments like I was almost driven crazy by Physics for the first time. From then on, I knew that the story between Physics and I may be near the ending. Another thing happened is that I did some program study those days and read more books about both Nature Science and Social Science especially Economics. A strange feeling of thirsty of concentrating more on Economics came to my heart due to the books I read. I talked to my parents, counsellor and Economics teacher several times. They all hoped that I could insist on what I really love. </p>
<p>AMC teaches me the real meaning of opportunity costs. Physics Bowl may teach me something about giving up. </p>
<p>Many teachers say I am a girl who has a strong demand for perfection, because it is common for me to take part in all the meaningful activities and play an active role in finishing tasks, in order to get satisfying result, even if I dislike the activities or lack time. During the preparation, everyday I was so busy to deal with every details in my life as many events had similar date, that it was difficult for me to calm down and go through the day again, so I decided to give up something to chill myself and reflect more. </p>
<p>I decided to give up Physics Bowl as a result of a lack of incentive of further study due to decreasing interest in Physics. Maybe we can regard this decision as a kind of releasing myself. </p>
<p>I would always be thankful for Physics Bowl as it helped me to discover that maybe it is so suitable for me to spend the rest of time learning Physics but Economics. Also, it provided me with a chance to think about giving up which is a thing I had never though about before. I don’t think that giving up equals to escaping. It is that choose to not choose something in our life because we may hope to choose other things. This is kind of admiration of being ourselves.</p>

    <title>Some records on IEO(International Economics Olympiad)</title>
    <url>/2021/04/29/AR%202021-04-29IEO/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I took part in International Economics Olympiad China Open Round on 11th April.</p>
<p>It was two weeks after my mock exams and three days after Euclid Mathematics Contest. Meanwhile, as the semester was near the end, most subjects final projects which had great influence on my GPA had the deadline at that week, including Economics, Business, Music and Visual Art.</p>
<p>Working to deadline is always my preference. However, after the mock exam, when going through the schedule, a reality came to me which was that the work was so much that it was almost impossible for me to deal with in just one week. I needed to make a plan ahead instead of missing deadline or finishing things curtly.</p>
<p>The plan was like that on Monday I needed to finish the outliner of Business project which would take me around 1 hour and the first part of Economics mind map which would take me about 2 hours. I thought I could finish everything perfectly and with high quality with the help of the plan. </p>
<p>However, the truth is that as it was difficult for me to estimate the time needed accurately, the plan was not completed at the first day, because Business outliner took me too much time. Every time when the time was not enough I chose to give up IEO.</p>
<p>I still understood that IEO was very important, because it is not a personal competition, but a team competition. I need to spend time preparing it as it is essential for me to be responsible to my teammate no matter whether they are responsible to me. The only thing I could do was to ask Economics teacher Ms. Grace for help. </p>
<p>I talked to Ms. Grace and asked her whether she could provide us with several office hours to go through the syllabus. She agreed. As Ms. Grace is an Economics teacher, she does not know about Business and Finance(30% of points were about Business and Finance). I hoped to read A-Level Business book to make sure I can solve the problems during the exam, but there was too much knowledge and too short time to finish. I went to my Business teacher Ms. Cindy. She provided me with a summarised book and several advices. The night before the exam, I spent about 8 hours finishing reading and understanding the book until 3 a.m.. I do not praise what I have done because enough sleeping is exactly important for us. I am still happy with is, as the result of discovering how interesting Business and Finance are and having the courage to challenging myself. </p>
<p>After finishing the exam, I knew that although I may not do IEO well and get low marks, I had tried my best and would not be guilty for not doing well. The result did not mean too much because the experiences and the feelings of challenging were more important. </p>
<p>To sum up, IEO taught me two lessons. The first one is that sometimes we maybe can not follow the plan, so it is important for us to both leave some spare time when making plan and record why we can not finish it to make sure the same thing will not happen for a second time. In addition, follow what you believe and you will find yourself improved through this process. Meanwhile, the whole universe will come to help you when you really want to achieve a thing, so you will gain more, such as the friendship between Ms. Cindy and I.</p>

    <title>Some records on Being Teaching Assistant</title>
    <url>/2021/05/30/AR%202021-05-30TA/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>During the revision for IGCSE, my economic teacher Ms. Cindy used the way of letting students act as teaching assistants to review the knowledge. </p>
<p>I was asked to go over the three sections on Macroeconomics. This was quite surprising because the three sections on Microeconomics which has even fewer knowledge points than Macroeconomics were allocated to three students in class. At that time, sense of responsibility came to my heart suddenly.</p>
<p>After that, I started to think about what to review and how to review. From my point of view, the details of Macro are linked together with strong logic, so I chose to use mind map. It really took me a lot time to finish the whole mind map although at the same time I was busy preparing for not only IGCSE but also competitions including IEO and Euclid, and the final presentation of several subjects. </p>
<p>Everything was finished perfectly before the revision day. Ms. Cindy spent several noon discussing the details in mind map with me, so I was exactly confident. Every details was excellent and Ms. Cindy praised me a lot .</p>
<p>Afterwards, I thought about why Ms. Cindy would like to provide me with this chance to challenge myself, although she always says that I am too shy or too nervous to give public speeches behind the whole class.</p>
<p>I could not help asking her about the reason. She smiled and looked at me quietly. Several seconds later, she told me that she hoped that I could practice my speech ability through this presentation. Meanwhile, the process of giving presentation would contribute to my Economics study, as she always looked forward for me to receiving a high mark in IGCSE Economics. </p>
<p>This is not privilege. It is the nice relationship between Ms. Cindy and I that inspires her to do that. The hundreds of afternoons spent together discussing all kinds of problems will be in my memory, which help me make connection with her. My junior high school head teacher once told me that if you want to get to understand someone else or make friends, the best way is to make connection with him or her through communicating and paying attention. </p>
<p>Being teaching assistant teaches me that in order not to let down other’s expectation, it may be better for us to try our best and give a perfect result as possible as we can. Meanwhile, communicating and paying attention are the best way to build an admired relationship as both sides make efforts.</p>

    <title>Some more records on IEO(International Economics Olympiad)</title>
    <url>/2021/06/17/AR%202021-06-17IEO2/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>In the evening of 28th April, I received the result of IEO.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, our team pass Open Round and get the chance to take part in China Final Round. Meanwhile, I personally got First Prize.</p>
<p>As soon as I got the result, I sent messages to Ms. Cindy who helped me a lot prepare Business and Finance part in IEO. She said, ‘God! Congratulations!’ Then, I told her that I really thanked her as she provided me with both help with learning Business knowledge and the incentive to continue doing instead of giving up. She said, ‘Sylvia, it is mainly you. Please come back with a grand prize in the final round!’</p>
<p>While being inspired by Ms. Cindy’s words, one of my teammate told me that he may not be able to take part in Final Round because of the time conflict with another competition. I was kind of upset and hoped that miracle would happen, but it didn’t happen. </p>
<p>This makes me rethink about responsibility. To prepare for the examination, I stayed up late and got up early to make sure that I would not hinder my teammates. However, when the result came out, the truth is that I get the highest points, although all my teammates got higher marks than me in a previous competition. However, I still reflected myself.</p>
<p>What is responsibility after all? It is the willingness and ability to respect the others and makes sure that you finish your duty fully. Maybe deciding to form a team with my current team is an action which is not responsible to myself as I didn’t talk to them about my aim before making the decision. Still, I didn’t ask my teachers for suggestion although we are from different classes and know little about each other. </p>
<p>To sum up, IEOC provides me with a chance to think about the responsibility again. I started to understand that the most important thing is to be responsible to myself and the to others. After this, all the teamwork may be completed successfully and happily. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Concerns about famine. If the country is suffering from overpopulated and low agricultural productivity, the risk of more dependents appears</p>
</li>
<li><p>Restrictions on improvements in living standards. Resources which could have been used to improve living standards may be devoted to the provision of necessities(OC)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Overcrowding. Put pressure on housing and social capital and cause traffic congestion</p>
</li>
<li><p>Environmental pressure. May damage to wildlife habitats, water shortages and the depletion of non-renewable resources</p>
</li>
<li><p>Pressure on employment opportunities.</p>
<ul>
<li>If there is an increase in the number of people of working age who lack skills(immigration), the government may need to pay more for education and training</li>
<li>*Remember: Immigration does not cause employment.(The number of job is not fixed) Immigration will increase the supply of labour and AD, if there is no available job or they have better skills, unemployment may appear.</li>

<li><p>Ways to reducing birth rate</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve the educational and employment opportunities for women</li>
<li>Improve healthcare and nutrition to reduce infant mortality and birth rate</li>
<li>Set up pension and sickness insurance schemes to reduce the need for family support</li>
<li>Raising school leaving age to raise costs of having children</li>
<li>Reduce or stop any financial support it gives to families for each child and provide incentives for families who restrict the number of children</li>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>My name is Yiran Dai. Others call me Sylvia. I am a student in Grade 10 at Nanjing Foreign Languages School International Curriculum Center.</p>
<p>I have spent 15 years living in Nanjing, which is my hometown. I have always longed to see the wide world outside Nanjing, so I have travelled gone to other places all over the world. For example, I visited the U.K. in 2017 with my friends. I can’t forget the beautiful views of the Thames. In addition, I enjoy playing the piano and the violin. Photography and reading interest me as well. </p>
<p>My family consists of my parents, two cats and me. My cats are fond of playing with me. Sometimes, I feed homeless cats in my school and community. My family regard me as an outgoing and kind girl.</p>
<p>I have a wide circle of friends. I organize activities and events for my class and school, such as the New Year Gala in my school. When we are stuck for fresh ideas, new ones come to me very quickly. When we face difficult problems, I help to come up with a solution quickly. They call me “the most creative female in the world”. When I asked my close friends why they had made friends with me, almost everyone told me that it was because I have a strong sense of ceremony. I remember their birthdays, anniversaries and important events and send messages to them. Additionally, I built friendships with my Physics and Economics teachers. They always praise me for my accurate self-assessment and efforts made in each subject.</p>
<p>I am really proud of myself in two respects. Firstly, as I mentioned above, I am capable of organising large events. I am happy to act as a leader. Secondly, although I am always in a hurry every day, I spare some time to listen patiently to others and to talk to them.</p>
<p>This is me, a girl who is both thoughtful and sensitive.</p>

    <title>A personal goal I have set for myself</title>
    <url>/2021/04/30/PS%202021-04-30%20Personal%20goals/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Junior High School had many challenges but the main one was the high amount of arguments that I had. There arguments caused a variety of problems such as losing several friends.</p>
<p>After graduation, I hoped to have matured and become less argumentative, but his goal was extremely hard to achieve, because I did not take any action such as trying to be calmer until I met Ms. Cindy, my senior high school Economics teacher. Being the class representative provided me with a lot of chances to communicate with her. We talked about all kinds of topics, including our class, the school, the subjects and even our families. During this process, I discovered that although she is a person who has many perspectives on small details, she seldom can’t help expressing the perspectives. She rarely becomes argumentative. After that, I started to pay attention to my temper and set a goal which was to be as non-confrontational and mild-mannered as Ms. Cindy.</p>
<p>To reach this goal over a period of six months I have had to try various strategies. I firstly searched the Internet. Most people said it would be very useful to read more books. Additionally, I asked Ms. Cindy for help and her advice was to consistently reflect on the discussion after quarrels and try my best to be patient and calm during communication. Meanwhile, I could come to her after quarrels to tell her the reasons and she would provide me with rational analysis.</p>
<p>After several more quarrels and rational reflection with analysis, it was not hard for me to feel that I have started to become more tolerant. It is easier for me to be tolerant with others and my attitude is improving.</p>
<p>Through this process, I have found that it is not too difficult for me to change myself if I am really thirsty for the this. It encourages me to set more goals and objectives to improve myself in order to become a better person or the person which is more ideal in my mind.</p>

    <title>Thinking on One Two Three…Infinite</title>
    <url>/2021/01/26/RR%202021-01-26Thinking%20on%20One%20Two%20Three%E2%80%A6Infinite%20/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>What is infinity? In wikipedia, infinity represents something that is boundless or endless, or else something that is larger than any real or natural number. </p>
<p>To be honest, I don’t understand every detail in the book. Although this book was written about a half century ago, some knowledge is not the most famous at the moment. However, this book is still not out of date actually. </p>
<p>To begin with counting, or maybe how to count, the author describes the ways which the ancient people followed to count. Meantime, he introduces some examples of enormous numbers. At last, he tells us several interesting definitions, like prime number and imaginary number, and famous theorem, like Fermat’s last theorem. </p>
<p>In the second chapter, the author introduces the four-dimensional space. This part becomes more difficult for me to understand as I have a poor ability of imagining. However, some interesting things attracted my attention. The four colour theorem reminds me of the geography lesson which I had during junior high school. That is the first time for me to get to know something about Topology. </p>
<p>The most unforgettable thing in the first two parts is an annotation given by the translator. The annotation is given during the author describe the four colour theorem. It says “This theorem has been proved during 1970s by the computer.” </p>
<p>What does this mean?</p>
<p>We all know that science has been developed rapidly in the past century. More and more theorems help people extend the science research. It becomes more difficult for non-professional people to learn, although in modern society, more convenient ways have been designed to learn new knowledge. Online reading is a good example. It is worth noting that, in these years, the things which have been develop do not only include science and technology, but also the ability of people to learn. This may be another thing the author want to tell us. That is the ability of people to learn is infinity as well. Humans have great potential energy to develop further in all the fields.</p>

    <title>Thinking on 25 Things You Need to Know About the Future</title>
    <url>/2020/12/16/RR%202020-12-16%2025%20things%20you%20need%20to%20know%20about%20the%20future/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I was inspired by a book called <strong>25</strong> <strong>things you need to know about the future</strong> written by Christopher Barnatt to discuss several details about the future development. </p>
<p>According to the two part I have read, the author holds the opinion that the new technology can help us save and reuse resources in the future and the aim is to reduce loss of energy during production. However, from my point of view, I don’t deny the author’s opinion, but we may need to pay more attention to sustainable development, like reusing resources as much as possible, clean energy like hydrogen energy and less pollution caused during production and daily life. Reducing loss may be not useful in long run as the total resource we owning is invariable, unless we achieve to use the resource as efficiently as over a large proportion. By contrast, reusing resources can consider the resource we owning is unlimited because we can always reuse them if they are used in correct ways. In addition, clean energy and less pollution supplement each other. Clean energy can reduce the cost of cleaning pollution and the waste caused during coal-based production. </p>
<p>As Hegel says, ‘but what experience and history teach is this – that nations and governments have never learned anything from history or acted upon any lessons they might have drawn from it.’ He means people can never go into a same river. Because we are at different time and meeting different problems, it is hard for us to follow the lessons which the history taught us. Both the author and I are analysing the trends of development. No one can judge who is correct or who is wrong through the history. The only thing we can do is to leave the right to judge to time.</p>
<p>The third part of the book has a meaningful name which can be regarded as a paronomasia. </p>
<p>The name is <strong>Fuelling the Third Millennium</strong>. The first layer of meaning is to analyse new resources or new ways to transforming energy in the following years to play the role of fuel, just like the oil in the past two millennium, while the second is to give some support to help and encourage the third millennium become better and better.</p>
<p>This part made me to think about a question — why do people create new things? Or I can explain it as what makes people to keep working instead of remaining unchanged? I think the answer is that people always desire something new to make the life much better and easier or some bad situations drive people to change. These two conditions differ from each other apparently. The first situation is to act spontaneously, consciously and initiatively. Compared with the first one, the second one is acting passively. From my point of view, the first situation is better than the second one, as the people realise themselves and own a heart of getting stronger. </p>
<p>Sometimes, some problems appear and then we take action. This is also kind of acting passively. However, if we can converse the way which we consider the world from being asked or forced to do something into acting spontaneously to improve ourselves and make a little contribution to the whole world to complete our own value of life, the result will not as bad as acting passively. Some changes will happen. </p>
<p>During the process of developing, situations discussed above will happen, but not limited to this. We may fail, just as the author wrote in the book, for example several rockets exploded. The loss of people’s lives and equipments can not be ignored. Anyway, the failure has been caused. The only thing we can do is to learn something from the failure and consider why we failed and how to be better next time. This is the thing that all the scientists who are trying to develop new ways to conserve the energy are doing now. They learn from the experience from the elderly and use the knowledge to do more experiments. They may fail as the elderly. They keep trying instead of giving up easily.</p>
<p>The last two parts of the books talk about two topics. One is computer science and inorganic life, while the other is future medicine. Although the author highly praised and held high expectation in these two fields, I still think these two topics can both be regarded as Pandora’s Box. </p>
<p>I never doubt that the computer science and medicine can play a positive, irreplaceable and essential role in human beings’ development. By contrast, I am worrying whether we have abilities to control the intelligent creatures designed and created by us. I read a short science fiction novel <strong>t**</strong>he** <strong>Bookshop at the End of the Universe</strong> written by Jiang Bo. The novel tells a story that after hundreds of years, humans can learn knowledge by technology instead of studying and reading books. Everyone is almost under the computers’ control as we can not think and study. This is kind of horrible and unacceptable. However, the significance of science fiction novel is to predict one result of development.</p>
<p>After considering the result of development, moral philosophy should also be discussed. Can we regard robots as humans, if they can think independently? Can we regard the knowledge which we get in other ways instead of learning by ourselves as the knowledge we own? Should people live an infinite lifespan? Everything is beyond the knowledge we have at present. It still requires a long time to complete the system of moral philosophy. In my opinion, things in the future, even tomorrow, are uncertain. As a result, these two parts of the book can be looked upon as discussion about whether we are ready to develop new technology. This comes back to the first part we discussed about this book above and makes a logic circle which might be intricate nowadays. </p>
<p>I really like this book, although the author and I have different opinions in several point. Additionally, it still is definitely shocked that some predictions in the books have become reality. The author predicted that a kind of virus would spread all over the world someday. This came true in 2020 as everyone knows that COVID-19 spread almost every corner on the Earth.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I have finished read this small book which predicts future. In some ways, I think this book is more likely to be a prediction on future technology, than future. Many points in the book make sense. We can only see a small part of the development of AI, Internet, biotechnology, nanotechnology and quantum physics. There is still a long way for us to go to discover how to put these things into use.</p>
<p>Today, many people merely consider their own benefit instead of owning the awareness of developing together. The society is not equal. The wealth you have may be able to decide how long you can live and how fast your wealth will grow. Gaps between people will become larger and larger, as a result, the competition will be more and more drastic. From my point of view, the solution is hidden in social science.</p>
<p>Future is about technology, but is more than it. It is more about the human beings and the society, including humanitarian things and a variety of meaningful things needed to be considered by us. </p>

    <title>Thinking on The Fuzzy and The Techie</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>This book mainly talks about the relationship between the Liberal Arts and digital world.</p>
<p>What is the Liberal Arts? Liberal arts generally covers four areas including the natural sciences, social sciences, arts and humanities. At present, there are some liberal arts colleges in the U.S.A. which are undergraduate institutions of high education, for example the Wellesley College. From my point of view, liberal arts plays an essential role in our society. First of all, liberal arts can also be described as “psychology”. All the liberal arts majors aim to research the way in which humans consider things and the influence on the society caused by these consideration. From example, Economics is the study which looks for the mentality of the consumers, producers and governments in a specific market. In addition, liberal arts also represents interdisciplinary study and research. A liberal arts education encourages students to integrates different areas of study, making students to explore a variety of subjects. This results in students can consider one problem from multiple perspectives.</p>
<p>What is STEM? STEM stands for science, technology, engineering and maths. These subjects promote the development of technology which has a wider meaning than the technology in STEM. This will result in a better living standard. For example, it is possible for us to print a house in a relative short time with a 3D printer which requires a long time with plenty of workers to finish.</p>
<p>I must point out that STEM and liberal arts coincide in some areas. For example, they both cover the natural science which include chemistry, physics and other subjects. </p>
<p>The first thing I want to talk about is the interdisciplinary studies. This is defined as the combination of two or more academic disciplines into one activity. When it happens, something is created by thinking across boundaries between different subjects. At present, a variety of interdisciplinary studies appears in our society for example the PPE ( Politics, Philosophy and Economics) and HSPS (Human, Social, and Political Sciences). During interdisciplinary studies, students can easily develop the skills of critical thinking, communication, creative problem solving, self-expression, innovative research and lifelong learning. This can promote the digital worlds as when we start an Internet company, everything needs to be considered detailedly without any mistakes. These skills will work. The study of liberal arts is mainly the interdisciplinary studies. To sum up, from the aspect of the interdisciplinary studies and the skills, the liberal arts is able to promote digital world.</p>
<p>The nest thing drawing my attention is the replacement by the technology. In the book, the author describes the situation in which the some workers are replaced by the technology, for example, the proportion of farmers has decreased a lot during the past century in America because of the development of automation. I still remembered the words which were said by my junior high school head teacher Mr. Cao. He said that in the future, we needed to concentrate in one areas to be more professional, because this could help us avoid being replaced by others. With the development of technology, the main problem has turned from replacement by the other workers to replacement by the technology. The times changed. Our competitor has changed from people to machines. I don’t mean that we need to reject all the technology. The most important thing is how to balance the relationship between technology and workers. From my point of view, overuse of technology may result in an increase in unemployment. Unskilled people may find it more and more difficult to earn a living. Skilled people must be more and more professional to keep their job. However, liberal arts can solve this problem in some ways. If everyone takes liberal arts, they will learn to think independently and critically. This results in that everyone has clear direction of self-development. Digital world can progress better in such social environment.</p>
<p>The last thing is people oriented. Why is liberal arts important? Except the reasons mentioned above, another vital reason is that liberal arts is kind of human based. In modern society, the technology can work out a variety of solutions of a problem, but it is difficult for them to choose, because the choices are made with consideration for a lot of factors, not only the costs and opportunity costs, as our society is made up of over seven billion people. A company which has workers can not survive without people oriented. After a long-time squeeze, people may do some crazy things. Everything will change, if the company is people oriented, Google discovered that if bosses greeted workers enthusiastically in the morning, the productivity would show an increase. </p>
<p>In conclusion, the liberal arts plays a positive role in the Digital World. However, I think liberal arts can influence all the fields optimistically because of its features. </p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Compare, to what extent, the advantages and disadvantages of rubbish landfill and incineration</strong></p>
<p><strong>Group: Salt fish</strong></p>
<p><strong>Members: Sylvia Dai; Yuki Yang; Tiffany Li; Vivian Yan.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Date: Thursday, June 24, 2021</strong></p>
<p><strong>Acknowledgement</strong></p>
<p>We would like to express our special thanks of gratitude to our teachers Mr. Abass, Ms. Brenda, Ms. Cindy, Ms. Dora and Mr. Paul who provided us with help during the process of completing the project Walk Without Wall, as well as our school Nanjing Foreign Language School International Centre who gave us the this opportunity to do this wonderful project.</p>
<p><strong>Brief Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Our group choose to compare, to what extent, the advantages and disadvantages of rubbish landfill and incineration in Nanjing using data provided and under ideal condition. The treatment of rubbish is an important issue in the city governance. In Nanjing, landfill and incineration are the main two ways of treating the wastes, with no less than two waste incineration plants and three landfills. We will pay our attention to the Jiangnan Waste Incineration Plants run by China Everbright Environment Group Limited Nanjing Branch Office.</p>
<p>In order to compare the advantages and disadvantages from an economic point of view, we will calculate their costs and benefits respectively and discuss their influence on the environment in a non-database way. </p>
<p><strong>Discussion about Landfill</strong></p>
<p>Landfill is the oldest and most common form of rubbish disposal. Although the systematic burial of the waste with daily, intermediate and final covers began in the 1940s, it is still the most popular one. For example, in 2018, 50% of the municipal solid wastes in the U.S.A. were landfilled and 38.5% of wastes were landfilled in the EU. </p>
<p>In Nanjing, more than 8000ton of rubbish is produced everyday. Based on the common sense, landfilling one ton of rubbish needs one cubic meter of the land, so the land required everyday is </p>
<p>8000ton × 1m3/ton = 8000m3</p>
<p>*Before being landfilled, the rubbish needs to be treated before. Unfortunately, we do not get information about its price. </p>
<p>Also, the landfilled rubbish also has other negative influences, including releasing the gases and leachate and the problem of vectors and other nuisances. </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Releasing gases</p>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>Landfill gas is a mix of different gases created by the action of microorganisms within a landfill as they decompose organic waste, including for example, food waste and paper waste. Landfill gas is approximately forty to sixty percent methane, with the remainder being mostly carbon dioxide. As they are green house gases, this may increase the temperature of the Earth. </li>
<li>No data available about the total quantity of gas released by one tonne of rubbish.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Releasing leachate</p>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>A leachate is any liquid that, in the course of passing through matter, extracts soluble or suspended solids, or any other component of the material through which it has passed. In the narrow environmental context leachate is therefore any liquid material that drains from land or stockpiled material and contains significantly elevated concentrations of undesirable material derived from the material that it has passed through.</li>
<li>No data available about the quantity of leachate released by one tonne of rubbish.</li>
<li>It is usually treated with special purifying system in order to reuse them in the industrial production to save water</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Problem of vectors</p>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>Poorly run landfills may become nuisances because of vectors such as rats and flies which can spread infectious diseases. The occurrence of such vectors can be mitigated through the use of daily cover.</li>
<li>No data available about the quantity of vectors caused by one tonne of rubbish.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Other nuisances </p>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>Other potential issues include wildlife disruption due to occupation of habitat and animal health disruption caused by consuming waste from landfills, dust, odor, noise pollution, and reduced local property values.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The analysis above discuss the negative sides of the rubbish landfill, which can be recognised as the external costs and costs of landfill. However, as some of the external costs are hard to measure in terms of the money. As a result, we will not do further calculation.</p>
<p>In the following part, the benefits of the landfill will be discussed.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Excellent energy resource</p>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>As we mentioned above, landfill will release gas including carbon dioxide and methane. In the ideal condition, these gases can be collected, filtered out, and used for energy production. </li>
<li>No data available about the total quantity of gas released by one tonne of rubbish.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Eco-friendly</p>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>If the city chooses to use the modern landfills, it is eco-friendly. Older landfills were just open-air dump for nearly everything but it isn’t the case anymore. Technology is well utilized in the landfills’ design; good soil lining and leachate management system ensures no seepage and damage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Keep cities, towns and districts clean</p>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>Any city that doesn’t have a landfill, they would simply dump waste in the vacant spots. This is unhealthy for humans and the environment. With properly maintained landfill facilities, local trash will be dealt with locally instead of shifting them to other countries.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Keep hazardous waste segregated</p>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>Landfills provide a place to dump recyclable and non-recyclable waste separately. Also, they provide a place to keep more hazardous materials that need to be segregated from the public.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Cheap</p>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>The costs only includes the costs of transportation, pre-disposal, labour and lands.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Discussion about incineration</strong></p>
<p>Incineration is a waste treatment process that involves the combustion of organic substances contained in waste materials. Industrial plants for waste incineration are commonly referred to as waste-to-energy facilities. The energy is usually transferred from chemical energy into electrical energy through a.c. generator. </p>
<p>The plant we discuss is the Jiangnan Waste Incineration Plants run by China Everbright Environment Group Limited Nanjing Branch Office. </p>
<p>Fixed costs are associated with the capital investment in the first year of the proposed incinerator, including three categories of costs: land acquisition costs, equipment and technology acquisition costs and construction and installation costs. We found the percentage of the three categories of costs of Guanghan, Tianjin, China. The table below shows its total costs and percentage. As it is the similar kind of incinerator, the percentage may be similar as well. </p>

</tbody></table>
<p>The total investment on the plants is 205million yuan, which is its total fixed costs. Using the figure provided. </p>
<p>The incinerator land acquisition is</p>
<p>205million × 1% = 20.5million</p>
<p>The incinerator equipment and technology acquisition is</p>
<p>205million × 70% = 143.5million</p>
<p>The incinerator construction and installation costs is </p>
<p>205million × 29% = 59.45million</p>
<p>The variable costs are the costs increase while the output increases. In this case, it mainly includes the collection costs from source to landfill, incinerator maintenance costs and incinerator operational costs. We found the way of calculation for the three costs respectively from an essay written by a Chinese student called Jiao Tang who was having his or her master degree in Vienna in 2012. We will show them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Collection costs from source to landfill</li>
</ul>
<p>We assume that the metals are not separated from the rest waste and also because the incinerator is within 1km distance to the current landfill. Additionally, based on the assumption that the distance between the incinerator and the landfill is 1km, the costs of collecting and transporting the residual bottom ash from the incinerator to the landfill is accounted for. The increased collection costs from source to landfill every year is therefore calculated as </p>
<p>Cc = (QwfII ‐ QwfI) × Pc1 + Qwl × Dl × Pc2  </p>
<p>Where Cc is the total increased collection costs from source to landfill, QwfII the quantity of waste flow from source to the incineration plant in Scenario II, QwfI the quantity of waste flow from source to the landfill inScenario I, Pc1 the unit costs of collection per ton of waste from source to the incineration plant, Qwl the quantity of residual bottom ash that is sent to the landfill, Dl the distance between the incinerator and the landfill and Pc2 the unit costs of collection per ton per km of bottom ash from the incinerator to the landfill. </p>
<p>The unit cost per ton of waste from source to the incineration plant is obtained from a study done for the city of Shenzhen on municipal solid waste collection cost (Li and Kong, 2011), while the unit cost per ton of waste per km is obtained from a study done for the municipality of Heping in the city of Tianjin (Research Office of Tianjing City Heping Municipal People’s Government, 2007). Furthermore, the price of collection cost increases every year by 6.17% per annum, calculated as:</p>
<p>Rcr = rdn × pd/c + rwn × pw/c </p>
<p>where Rcr is the rate of collection costs increase per year, rdn the rate of diesel price increase per year, pd/c the percentage of diesel costs as a component of collection costs, rwn the rate of wage increase per year, and pw/c the percentage of wage costs as a component of collection costs. </p>
<ul>
<li>Incinerator maintenance cocsts</li>
</ul>
<p>Incinerator maintenance costs are the costs of maintaining and repairing the equipment at the incineration plant. According to a study on waste incineration enterprise information system (Anon, 2011), the annual costs of maintenance is approximately 3% of capital investment on the equipment. </p>
<p>3% × 205million = 6.15million</p>
<ul>
<li>Incinerator operational costs</li>
</ul>
<p>The yearly operational costs of the incineration plant includes utility cost (water, electricity, gas), human resource costs, costs of chemical materials needed for air pollution control, costs of auxiliary fuel when needed, costs of materials for amenity and office maintenance, the other administrative costs, excluding equipment maintenance costs. The operational costs every year are calculated as:</p>
<p>Co = Qwi × Po</p>
<p>Where Co is the operational costs, Qwi the waste input into the incinerator, and Po the unit costs of operation. </p>
<p>As it is impossible for us to calculate the latter two costs clearly, so the total costs can not be calculated. However, the calculation above may not be accurate out of the consideration of outmoded, floating exchange rate and inflation over the 10-year period.</p>
<p>Also, the incineration will have some other environmental costs. </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Pollution</p>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>Incinerators produce smoke during the burning process. The smoke produced includes acid gases, carcinogen dioxin, particulates, heavy metals, and nitrogen oxide. These gases are poisonous to the environment. Research has shown that dioxin produced in the plant is a cancer forming chemical.</li>
<li>The quantity of gases produced by the plant can be got online. We can see from the table below. Every furnace produces all kinds of the gases. Although it is far less than the standard, this will still influence the environment.</li>

</ul>
<p>The analysis above discuss the negative sides of the rubbish incineration, which can be recognised as the external costs and costs of incineration. However, as some of the external costs are hard to measure in terms of the money. As a result, we will not do further calculation.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the incineration has some output which can make contribution to the economic growth. The output main includes the fly ash, the smoke, the slag and the leachate. There, at the same time, are the production of electricity using the chemical energy released from combustion.</p>
<p>It is possible to calculate the electricity produced in terms of the quantity and the money.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In quantity</p>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>When producing at full capacity, the total quantity of unrecyclable wastes can be dealt in one day in the two phases is</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>2000ton + 2000ton = 4000ton</p>
<ul>
<li><ul>
<li>It is know that one tonne of unrecyclable wastes can produce no less than 476.83 kWh of electricity. So the total quantity of electricity produced everyday is</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>4000t × 476.83kWh/t = 1907320 kWh ≈ 1.91 × 106 kWh</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In money</p>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>It is know that price of the electricity in average is 0.35yuan/kWh*. As a result, the total revenue the plant can gain from electricity everyday is </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>1.91 × 106 kWh × 0.35yuan/kWh = 667562 yuan ≈ 6.7 × 105 yuan</p>
<p>It is also possible to calculate the water produced in terms of the money.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In money</p>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>It is know that the plant creates 2000m3/day of the leachate, most of which is turned into industrial used water. The useful water may be approximately 1800m3/day. The price of the industrial used water is 4.10yuan/m3 in China. As a result, the total revenue the plant can gain from water everyday is</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>1800m3/day × 4.10yuan/m3 = 7380 yuan</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it is said that the slag can be used to produce the bricks which are used for establishing the roads and other infrastructure. Unluckily, we do not have the data about the quantity of the slag is produced everyday. </p>
<p>Still, the incineration has some other benefits as well as those of landfills.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Decrease quantity of wastes</p>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>Incinerators can decrease the quantity of waste by 95% and reduce the solid quantity of the original waste by 80-85% depending on the components that were in solid waste. Hence, even though incinerators do not completely get rid of dumping ground, they definitely decrease the quantity of land needed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Efficient waste management</p>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>Incineration plays a vital role in making waste management easier and more efficient.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Reduction of pollution</p>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>Research has shown that solid waste incinerators are less likely to pollute the environment than landfills. One particular study done during a 1994 lawsuit in the US showed that a waste incinerator location was more environment-friendly compared to a landfill. It will reduce both air pollution and water pollution.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Filters for trapping pollutants</p>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>The main problem concerning the incineration of solid waste was the release of hazardous compounds, particularly dioxin. Nonetheless, up to date incinerator plants use filters to trap hazardous gases and particulate dioxin.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Better control over odor and noise</p>

<p>It is obvious that the landfill has much more costs than incineration and much fewer benefits. However, nowadays, many cities and countries still choose to use landfill instead of using incineration due to a lack of technology and spare money. Choosing incineration may become a future trend in the field of rubbish treatment. Still, the other new methods such as biodegrading will be developed in the near future which can make the treatment be more efficient, economical and eco-friendly. </p>
<p>In an essay written by a professor from South Korea mentions that among four kinds of treatment methods, including incineration, RPF boiler, RPF furnace and cement furnace, the incineration has the lowest total costs. The government and company may consider in this way during choosing the way of disposal of rubbish.</p>

</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Demand for the product</p>
<ul>
<li>As the demand for labour is a derived demand. The demand for the goods and services increases, so the demand for labour to produce them will increase</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Costs of other factors of production</p>
<ul>
<li>An increase in the price of capital may increase the demand for workers as it is possible to substitute labour for capital</li>

<li>An increase in requirement for qualifications will make the supply of the labour low as the number of people with the willingness and ability to undertake a long period of challenging training is low</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Non-wage benefits of the job</p>
<ul>
<li>A decrease in non-wage benefits may reduce people’s willingness to do it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Wage or non-wage benefits in other jobs</p>
<ul>
<li>A rise in the benefits in other jobs will encourage some workers to switch from one occupation to another</li>

<li><p>Age and experience</p>
<ul>
<li>An increase in age and experience can increase the worker’s bargaining power and its higher wages.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Government policies</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Clearly influences the wages of those workers whom it employs in the public sector</p>
</li>
<li><p>Specific government policies may have an impact on particular occupations</p>
</li>
<li><p>Directly affect wages–National Minimum Wage</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Results</p>
<ul>
<li>If the government introduces an NMW which is above the equilibrium wage, the quantity supplied will extend and the quantity demanded will contract. A surplus of labour appears and results in unemployment</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Consequences</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Advantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Workers have a fair or liveable wages and are not exploited by the employers</li>
<li>Create incentive for the unemployed to work</li>
<li>Low income earners have more money to spend and increase consumption and ease the fears higher wages will cause unemployment</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Disadvantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Workers who earn more than NMW may ask for a higher wage to maintain the wage differential</li>
<li>Unemployment may increase as an increase in costs of labour make firms to purchase more capital goods</li>
</ul>

<li>Influence the wages claims made by the workers</li>
<li>Put pressure on a government to revise the wages it pays to the public sector workers</li>
<li>Attitudes towards women. If social attitudes are against working women, it is harder for women to find employment and may receive significantly less pay than male counterparts</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Discrimination</p>
<ul>
<li>It occurs when a group of workers is treated unfavourable in terms of employment, the wage rate, the training received and promotional opportunities</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Stages of production</p>
<ul>
<li><p>People work in primary sector may usually less well-paid than those who work in secondary and tertiary sectors.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Reasons</p>
<ul>
<li>Workers in primary sector tend to be less skilled and have fewer qualifications</li>
<li>With the development of the economy, the demand for primary sector workers usually declines</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Earnings of individuals over time</p>
<ul>
<li>The longer people work, the more skilled and productive they tend to become. An increase in productivity is caused by gaining experience and undertake training</li>
<li>Some older workers may decide to give up working overtime and some may switch to less demanding work, so the wages and bonuses reduces</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Extent to which earnings change</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Determinant of elasticity of demand for labour</p>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Division and specialisation of labour</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Specialization</p>
<ul>
<li>It occurs when a worker become an experts in a particular profession</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Division</p>
<ul>
<li>It occurs when a production process or task is split between different workers who become experts in a part of the process</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Consequences</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Advantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Workers become experts in their field, so the productivity and efficiency increases. The average costs of production decreases</li>
<li>Quality of the products or services increases</li>
<li>Workers become more skilled so their earning potential increases</li>
<li>Create higher motivation, productivity, output and competitiveness for the firms</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Disadvantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Workers may get bored, make more mistakes and decrease productivity</li>
<li>Workers may become alienated</li>
<li>Become too dependent on an individual workers and be hard to cover for the workers who are off sick or under training</li>

<ul>
<li>Enjoy economies of scale. This means they can have low average costs of production and have  international competitiveness against foreign competitiors</li>
<li>Have financial resources to invest in innovation. Research and development expenditure can help to generate new ideas, products and production processes. Innovation can act as a source of profit and improve productive capacity</li>
<li>Eliminate wasteful competition. This is because profit-seeking firms may not have much of a financial incentive to provide services in remote areas of the country and a single provider can gain huge economies of scale. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Disadvantages</p>
<ul>
<li>No substitutes. The demand is price inelastic so they can charge higher prices due to price makers to maximise profits</li>
<li>High barriers may prevent new firms. This limits the degree of competition and ensure monopolists continue to charge high prices</li>
<li>Less incentive to innovate. Because of a lack of competitive pressure, they may become complacent rather than focusing on innovations</li>

<h3 id="Objectives"><a href="#Objectives" class="headerlink" title="Objectives"></a>Objectives</h3><ul>
<li><p>Survival</p>
<ul>
<li>At the beginning of a business, their initial objective may be survival</li>
<li>During difficult times when demand is falling, large firms may have survival as objectives</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Growth</p>
<ul>
<li>An increase in size may bring advantages like economies of scale</li>
<li>Those who run firms may want the growth as their pay and status may be closely linked to the size of the firm and increase gob security</li>
<li>If growth is achieved by merging, competition will be reduced and the company may gain a larger market share</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Social welfare</p>
<ul>
<li>Public sector companies may aim at improving social welfare through charging relative low prices to ensure they are affordable. Also, they may get to understand the externalities</li>
<li>Some private sector firms also show concern about environmental and social effects of their actions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Profit satisficing</p>
<ul>
<li>Make enough dividends to keep shareholders happy while pursuing other objectives</li>

</li>
<li><p>Profit maximisation</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Other objectives may conflict with this, but pursuit of them may actually increase profits in the long run.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Formula: profit=revenue-cost; It is maximised when the gap between total revenue and total costs is the highest</p>
</li>
<li><p>Effect of changes in profit</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide an incentive with entrepreneurs to undertake production</li>
<li>Provide firms with more finance to update their capital equipment and expand their business</li>
<li>Make it easier to obtain external finance</li>
<li>Easier to recruit top managers and directors, attracted by their success</li>
<li>A fall in profit may have little impact on the behaviour of firms in the short run. But in the long run, firms may cut back on production and cease production</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Ways of increasing profit</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Reduce costs of production</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce any wastages and inefficiency</li>
<li>Increase the productivity of factors of production</li>
<li>Increase the size of the firm to enjoy economies of scale or stronger market power to make demand be inelastic</li>

<li><p>A high number of members</p>
<ul>
<li>The more the members a union has, the more funds it has to finance its activities. </li>
<li>It is difficult to replace union labour by non-union labour.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>A high level of skills</p>
<ul>
<li>Unions with skilled workers are in a relative strong position as it is difficult to replace skilled workers with other skilled workers and expensive to train unskilled workers</li>

</li>
<li><p>A consistent demand for product produced by the workers</p>
<ul>
<li>Unions that represent workers making essential goods and services are in strong position to bargain</li>

<li><p>Favourable government legislation</p>
<ul>
<li>If the governments allow industrial action, the trade union will be in a stronger position</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>A high level of economic activity</p>
<ul>
<li>If output and income in a country increase, more industries may perform well, so wages and non-wage factors may improve. Also, when output reaches high levels and most people are employed, firms may compete for workers. So bargaining power increases</li>

</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Ways"><a href="#Ways" class="headerlink" title="Ways"></a>Ways</h3><ul>
<li><p>Collective bargaining</p>

<li>Workers deliberately slow down production by complying rigidly with every rule and regulation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Go-slow</p>
<ul>
<li>Workers carry out tasks deliberately slowly to reduce production</li>

<h3 id="Consequences"><a href="#Consequences" class="headerlink" title="Consequences"></a>Consequences</h3><ul>
<li><p>Advantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide a channel of communication between employers and employees. This makes firms less time consuming, less stressful and cheaper to negotiate with workers as a group</li>
<li>They encourage workers to engage in education and training to raise productivity</li>

<ul>
<li>It occurs when workers are made redundant as a result of advances in ICT</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Structural employment is more serious than frictional unemployment as it persists for longer periods and usually affects more workers</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Cyclical unemployment</p>
<ul>
<li>Definition: It is prolonged and widespread unemployment during an economic recession due to falling and depressed aggregate demand</li>
<li>It is more serious than structural unemployment as potentially it can affect more workers and it is spread throughout the country</li>

<li><p>Inflation</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Definition: It is the sustained rise in the general price level in an economy over time</p>
</li>
<li><p>Causes</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Cost-push inflation</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It occurs when the price level is pushed up by increases in the costs of production. As costs are higher, producers will raise their prices to maintain their profit margins</p>
</li>
<li><p>Reasons</p>
<ul>
<li>Wages increase more than labour productivity</li>
<li>Increase in the cost of raw materials</li>
<li>Increase in indirect taxes</li>
<li>Higher cost of capital goods</li>
<li>Increase in profit margins by firms</li>

</li>
<li><p>Demand-pull inflation</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It occurs when the price level is pulled up by an excess demand</p>
</li>
<li><p>Reasons</p>
<ul>
<li>Higher consumption, higher investment, higher government expenditure, higher net export</li>
<li>A shortage of some resources so it is not possible to produce any more output</li>

<li>Inflation rate</li>
<li>Stability of this rate</li>
<li>Rate relative to the inflation rates in other countries</li>
<li>Reaction of the government</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Advantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Encourage firms to expand</li>
<li>Reduce the real burden of any debt</li>
<li>Prevent some workers being made redundant in a declining industry or region as they may accept their wages rising by less than inflation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Disadvantages</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Producer</p>
<ul>
<li>Menu costs are costs involved in changing prices in catalogues, price lists and slot machines</li>
<li>Shoe leather costs arise because money paid to firms will be losing its value as son as it is received. Seeking out good financial returns will involve the time and effort of firms</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>A fall in the value of money. There will be a fall in the real income and purchasing power.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Redistribute income in an unplanned way</p>
<ul>
<li>Savers will lose out from inflation because the money they saved is worth less than before. Also, this discourages saving and reduce bond which results in lower investment</li>
<li>Borrowers gain from inflation as the money they need to repay is worth less than when they initially borrowed it</li>
<li>Lenders will lose out from inflation because the money they lent out to borrowers becomes worth less than before</li>
<li>Fixed income earners and pensioners will have a fall in their real income</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Uncertainty. It makes it harder to judge right prices and plan ahead. Firms may be discouraged from investment</p>
</li>
<li><p>Harm balance of payment. If the country’s inflation rate is above that of its rivals, its products will become less price competitive so export will fall and import will increase. Unemployment may appear meanwhile</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fiscal drag. When government don’t adjust tax brackets in line with inflation, so people’s incomes are dragged into higher tax brackets and they are left with lower real disposable income</p>

</li>
<li><p>Causes</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Beneficial</p>

<li>Advances in technology and increase in labour productivity may reduce price level. Consumers can enjoy more products and country be more internationally competitive</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Harmful</p>
<ul>
<li>A decline in AD. Consumers may expect prices to be lower so they may decrease purchase and output will decrease. Unemployment may increase.</li>

<li>Increase output and employment</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Harmful deflation</p>
<ul>
<li>A fall in demand may cause a fall in the demand for labour and increase unemployment</li>
<li>Consumers spend less so firms may have lower revenue to repay costs and liabilities. Bankruptcies may appear</li>
<li>Decrease consumer confidence so they will spend less and results in a downwards deflationary spiral</li>
<li>Real costs of debts increase. This will make consumers and firms decrease confidence</li>

<ul>
<li><p>The higher the real GDP per head, the greater economic development tends to be.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Problems</p>
<ul>
<li>Inequalities in distribution of income</li>
<li>Composition of GDP should be considered</li>
<li>Economic growth can bring about problems, so other factors should also be considered</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Productivity</p>
<ul>
<li>Higher productivity will make it easier to develop</li>
<li>Foreign direct investment will increase productivity in quantity and quality of FOPs so increase the productive capacity and competitiveness, create jobs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Population growth</p>
<ul>
<li>countries with high population growth may have a high dependency ratio so government will spend more in education</li>
<li>Rapid population growth can limit any increase in real GDP as it reduces the GDP per capita.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Size of primary, secondary and tertiary sectors</p>
<ul>
<li>As an economy develops, there tends to be a shift away from reliance on primary and secondary sector production towards tertiary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Saving</p>
<ul>
<li>Due to different income, poor people can’t afford to save so the country with low average income may have low savings ratio. This will be a lack of finance for investment</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Investment</p>
<ul>
<li>Countries with low value of capital goods per worker may have low income per head</li>
<li>Countries with low savings may be hard for firms to borrow, so investment may be low and can’t contribute directly to economic development</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Education and healthcare</p>
<ul>
<li>A lack of access to or poor quality of education and healthcare will reduce living standards and low productivity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Concentration on a narrow range of exports</p>
<ul>
<li>Countries that export a narrow range of products can be adversely affected by large decrease in demand or supply</li>

<h3 id="Why-aim-for-economic-development"><a href="#Why-aim-for-economic-development" class="headerlink" title="Why aim for economic development"></a>Why aim for economic development</h3><ul>
<li>Higher real GDP, higher living standards and expansion of the range of economic and social choices</li>
<li>Have potential to raise material living standards</li>
<li>Enjoy more goods and services</li>
<li>Life expectancy may be increased and infant mortality rate may be reduced</li>
<li>Higher living standards</li>
<li>Distribution of income does not become too uneven and poverty is reduced</li>
<li>Expanding the range of economic and social choices, increasing freedom and self-esteem includes increasing access to education, healthcare and participation in the political process. This will improve the quality of lives and enhance future economic performance</li>

<li><p>High growth of population</p>
<ul>
<li>A high birth rate can result in resources being used</li>
<li>In the low run, higher birth rate increases the country’s productive potential and living standards</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>High levels of international debt</p>
<ul>
<li>Opportunity cost of repaying debt may be economic development. As poor countries may borrow heavily, a large percentage of country’s income is taken up in repaying loans</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Reliance on the export of primary products</p>
<ul>
<li>The price of primary products tends to fall so they receive less for exports and pay more for imports.</li>
<li>Consuming and rich countries use their buying power to keep down the prices</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Lack of investment in capitals and humans</p>
<ul>
<li>This may hold back the increases in productivity, introduction of new technology and international competitiveness</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Emigration of key workers</p>
<ul>
<li>Key workers may seek better-paid employment abroad</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Trade restrictions on their products</p>
<ul>
<li>Tariffs make it difficult for developing countries to sell their products at home and abroad.</li>
<li>Tariffs also build up as the goods are processed into higher-value-added goods, so that economies are discouraged from building up their industries</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Unbalanced economies</p>
<ul>
<li>Certain markets may be under-developed such as the financial sector. A lack of developed financial sector is likely to discourage saving and investment</li>

<li>Definition: It occurs when people are poor relative to other people in the country</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Causes of poverty </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Unemployment</p>
<ul>
<li>The unemployed may be poor due to low literacy, unskilled and illness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Low wages</p>
<ul>
<li>Lower GPD per head, poorer the country tends to be due to the low wages in the economy. Low wages may due to unskilled workers, so they may have low wages, low consumption and investment. These results in poverty.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Illness</p>
<ul>
<li>A lack of healthcare reduce life expectancy in a country. The lower the life expectancy, the poorer the country tends to be and so the greater the degree of poverty in the country. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Low literacy rates</p>
<ul>
<li>This measures the proportion of the population aged 15 and above who can read and write</li>
<li>Low-income country tend to have low literacy rates due to lack of sufficient education. This causes high unemployment and low productivity. It is hard to eradicate poverty.</li>

<li>One or some countries may gain control of most of the global market and restrict supply to push up the price</li>
<li>May not follow the same health and safety standards as the home country</li>
<li>Any problems happened in the country may stop the country from producing so in the short run the product is not available</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Too dependent on other counties for the markets of the products they produce and for the sources of their raw materials</li>
<li>May experience a fall in demand as tastes may change or foreign counties become more efficient or a substitute may be developed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>For the economy</p>
<ul>
<li>Hard to determine what an economy is best at producing and what will be in demand in the future</li>
<li>If demand suddenly falls or costs rise, the country may run into difficulties and results in structural unemployment</li>

<li><p>Trade</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Definition: International trade refers to the exchange of goods and services beyond national borders. It entails the sale of exports (goods and services sold to overseas buyers) and imports (foreign goods and services bought by domestic households and firms).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Definition: Free trade means that international trade can take place without any forms of protection (barriers to international trade), such as quantitative limits or taxes being imposed on exports.</p>
<ul>
<li>Advantages </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Connection between specialisation and international trade</p>
<ul>
<li>Producing a relatively narrow range of products will mean that countries will have to export some of their output. This is necessary for them to gain revenue for spending on imports of products that their citizens want to buy, but their countries are not producing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Globalisation</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Definition: Globalisation is the process by which the world’s economies become increasingly interdependent and interconnected due to greater international trade and cultural exchanges. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Consequences</p>
<ul>

<ul>
<li>Foreign country–Through job creation, improve standards of living in the countries</li>
<li>Firms&amp;consumers–MNCs enjoy economies of scale so MNCs can pass on cost savings to their consumers in form of lower prices</li>
<li>Firms&amp;home country–By operating in overseas market, MNCs are able to generate more profits because of an increase in consumer base(profit are repatriated so home country benefits)</li>
<li>Firms&amp;foreign country–MNCs move or expand their operations in foreign countries to benefit from lower rates of corporation tax.</li>
<li>Firms–Spread risks by operating overseas</li>
<li>Firms–Avoid any trade restrictions</li>
<li>Firms–Access new markets by locating overseas and reduce transportation costs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Disadvantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Workers–Unethical and cost-cutting practises</li>

<li>Local government–They are often in a powerful position to exploit foreign governments over decisions</li>
<li>Local country–Higher unemployment</li>
<li>Local country–Over-reliance on MNCs in low income countries means there are major consequences should an MNC choose to relocate the operation</li>
<li>MNCs– Hard to manage the overall business because of a lack of effective communications</li>
<li>MNCs– Fluctuating exchange rate makes it difficult to measure and compare the value of MNCs’ sales and profits</li>
<li>MNCs– May not provide goods and services appealed to local tastes and consumers</li>

<h3 id="Protection"><a href="#Protection" class="headerlink" title="Protection"></a>Protection</h3><ul>
<li><p>Definition: Protection refers to the use of trade barriers to restrict foreign trade, thereby limiting overseas competition</p>
</li>
<li><p>Methods</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Tariff</p>
<ul>
<li>It is a tax on imports.</li>
<li>Tariff increases the cost of production and the price of imports in domestic market, so the quantity of imports reduces</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Import quotas</p>
<ul>
<li>It sets a quantitative limit on the scale of a foreign goods in a country.</li>
<li>Quota limits the quantity imported</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Subsidies</p>
<ul>
<li>Government can provide subsidies to domestic firms to compete against importers</li>
<li>Subsidies lower the costs of production for home firms</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Embargo</p>
<ul>
<li>It is a ban on trade with a certain country, due to a trade dispute or political conflict</li>
<li>An embargo rarely benefits local consumers as they suffer from a lack of choices and higher prices</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Exchange control</p>
<ul>
<li>A government try to decrease import through restricting the availability of foreign currency</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Quality standards</p>
<ul>
<li>A country may ask imports to reach artificially high standards results in dissuading other countries from selling or pushing up prices</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Expensive paperwork</p>
<ul>
<li>Require foreign firms to fill out a considerable amount of time-consuming paperwork</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Voluntary export restraints(VERs)</p>
<ul>
<li>A government may persuade the foreign government to agree to restrict the number of units of a product sold by it</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Consequences</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Advantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Help the infant industries from foreign competition and safeguard domestic jobs, because in extreme cases, fierce competition from foreign rivals can even force domestic firms out of business.</li>
<li>Prevent foreign countries dumping(occurs when foreign firms sell their products in large quantities at prices deliberately below those charged by domestic firms, often even below the cost of production)</li>
<li>Increase government revenue</li>
<li>Overcome a balance of payment deficit as restricting imports will help to deal with it</li>
<li>To protect strategic industries instead of relying on foreign countries</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Disadvantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Government intervention may distort market signals and results in an international misallocation of resources. The domestic companies may become too reliant on government and become inefficient</li>
<li>Decreasing competition and incentive for innovation may lead to an increase in price. Costs of raw materials may increase as well and results in imported inflation</li>
<li>Other countries may react with retaliating and imposing their own barriers. This may hinder global economic growth and prosperity</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Exchange-rate"><a href="#Exchange-rate" class="headerlink" title="Exchange rate"></a>Exchange rate</h3><ul>
<li><p>Definition: An exchange rate refers to the price of one currency measured in terms of other currencies. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Determination</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Demand for currency</p>
<ul>
<li>This means that as the value of a country’s currency rises, its demand for imports tends to increase.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Supply of currency</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Floating exchange rate</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Definition: In floating exchange rate, the value of the currency is determined by the market forces of demand for the currency and supply of the currency</p>
</li>
<li><p>Change in exchange rate</p>
<ul>
<li>Definition: An appreciation in the exchange rate if the exchange rate is rising against other currencies</li>
<li>Definition: A depreciation in the exchange rate if the exchange rate is falling against other currencies</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Fixed exchange rate</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Definition: In a fixed exchange rate system, the government intervenes in foreign exchange markets to maintain its exchange rate at a predetermined level</p>
</li>
<li><p>Main advantage: reducing the uncertainties for international trade makes domestic and foreign firms to be certain about future costs and prices and encourages international trade and exchange</p>
</li>
<li><p>This is achieved by the respective government buying and selling foreign currencies</p>
</li>
<li><p>Change in exchange rate</p>
<ul>
<li>Definition: A revaluation in the exchange rate if the exchange rate is rising against other currencies</li>
<li>Definition: A devaluation in the exchange rate if the exchange rate is falling against other currencies</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Causes of exchange rate fluctuations</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Floating exchange rate system</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Changes in demand for exports: An increase in the demand for export will increase the demand for the country’s currency and increase the exchange rate</p>
</li>
<li><p>Changes in demand for imports: An increase in the demand for import will increase the demand for foreign currency and increase the value of foreign currency</p>
</li>
<li><p>Prices and inflation: An increase in the price of goods and services caused by domestic inflation will decrease the demand for exports</p>
</li>
<li><p>Foreign direct investment(FDI): Investment in overseas production plant requires the use of foreign currencies</p>
<ul>
<li>Inward FDI(eg. the entry of an MNC)will boost the demand for a currency</li>
<li>Outward FDI(eg. departure of an MNC)will increase the supply of a currency</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Speculation: foreign exchange traders and investment companies move money around the world to take advantage of higher interest rates and variations in exchange rates to earn a profit. As huge sums of money(hot money)are involved, speculation can cause exchange rate fluctuations. They might lack confidence and therefore withdraw their investment and depreciate the currency</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Fixed exchange rate system</p>
<ul>
<li>Government intervention</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Consequences of appreciation and revaluation</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Advantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Consumers will have greater purchasing power</li>
<li>Importers gain from a strong dollar because the raw materials, components and finished goods will be cheaper. But this is bad for domestic producers</li>
<li>As unemployment decreases, the inflation rate will decrease. Also, if the country relies heavily on imports, the higher exchange rate will reduce general price level</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Disadvantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Exporters may face difficulties as exchange rate increases caused by their goods and services become more expensive for foreign consumers</li>
<li>A fall in net exports and deteriorating profits will cause job losses in export-oriented businesses and increase unemployment</li>
<li>In the long run, as a result of the higher exchange rate, economic growth is likely to fall due to the combination of lower export sales and higher unemployment.</li>
<li>If a currency appreciation has a larger impact on exports than imports (that is, there is a fall in the value of net exports), then the balance of payments will worsen, as a strong currency will make it more difficult for exporters to sell their goods and services in overseas markets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Coping with a strong exchange rate</p>
<ul>
<li>Cutting export prices to maintain their price competitiveness against foreign rivals</li>
<li>Seeking alternative suppliers of cheaper raw materials</li>
<li>Improving productivity to keep costs of production low</li>
<li>Provide more price inelastic demand products as consumers are not sensitive with price change caused by exchange fluctuations</li>
<li>Improving non-price factors, including brand awareness and social responsibility</li>
<li>Relocate the production process overseas</li>
</ul>
</li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Primary income</p>
<ul>
<li>Definition: It is the income earned by people working in different countries and investment income which comes into and goes out of the country</li>

<ul>
<li><p>Definition: A current account deficit occurs when its import expenditure is greater than its export earnings(the current account has a negative balance)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Causes</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Lower demand for exports</p>
<ul>
<li>A decline in manufacturing competitiveness(may caused by higher labour costs domestically)</li>
<li>A decline income in foreign market(may due to a decrease in available money caused by an economic recession)</li>
<li>An increase in exchange rate which makes exports more expensive and reduce the volume and value of exports</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Higher demand for imports</p>
<ul>
<li>Cheaper or better quality of imports(cheaper may due to a decrease in exchange rate)</li>
<li>Domestic inflation which makes imports relatively cheaper</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Consequences</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Advantages</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Lower exchange rate</p>
<ul>
<li>The demand for the domestic currency decreases so the exchange rate decreases and exports become more competitive</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Disadvantages</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Reduced demand</p>
<ul>
<li>As the economy is spending more on imports that it is receiving, the demand in economy will fall and a recession may be triggered</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Unemployment</p>
<ul>
<li>A fall in overall demand may cause cyclical unemployment. Also, the wages may decrease</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Lower standards of living</p>
<ul>
<li>The deficit may be caused by capital outflows exceed capital inflows. The economy may suffer from lower standards of living as income is less. Also, households and firms may need to reduce spending</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Increased borrowing</p>
<ul>
<li>Deficit means spending more than income. Government needs to borrow money to overcome the difference which results in interest and repayment of the loan(any money which government spends has an opportunity cost)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Surplus</p>
<ul>

</li>
<li><p>Causes</p>
<ul>
<li><p>High demand for exports</p>
<ul>
<li>An improvement in manufacturing competitiveness(may caused by higher labour productivity in domestic economy)</li>
<li>Higher incomes in overseas markets</li>
<li>A decrease in exchange rate</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Low demand for imports</p>
<ul>
<li>Imports are more expensive or of a lower quality</li>
<li>Inflation in overseas countries causes import tend to be expensive</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Consequences</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Advantages</p>
<ul>
<li>A fall in unemployment in domestic economy, but an increase in unemployment in other countries</li>
<li>The country receive high income because the home country has a competitive advantage in the product they export and result in a better living standards</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Disadvantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Higher demand for exports may lead to demand-pull inflation and diminish the international competitiveness</li>
<li>Higher demand for exports can cause the currency to appreciate in value and foreign buyers will find it more expensive to import goods into their countries.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Policies to achieve balance of payment stability</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Fiscal policy</p>
<ul>
<li>Higher taxes and reduced government spending to decrease the amount of money available to spend on imports</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Monetary policy</p>
<ul>
<li>Floating–Higher interest rates make new and existing loans more expensive for households and firms to reduce demand for imports</li>
