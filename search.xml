    <title>SOME RECORDS ON NEC</title>
    <url>/2020/12/21/NEC/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Last Sunday afternoon, 2020 21st Dec, I finished my NEC exam. </p>
<p>I have prepared for the exam since I decided to take part in it. When the words ‘EXAM IS OVER’ appeared on my screen, I was a little bit disappointed because there were many questions which I found I could not do anything with. </p>
<p>About four months ago, when I talked to my Economics teacher Ms.Cindy, I heard about NEC for the first time. She told me that NEC is National Economics Challenge and advantages and disadvantages of it. I decided to take part in it as I discovered that I am really interested in Economics.</p>
<p>Then, I discussed with my friends. We founded a group called ‘Together Group’ because we hoped that everyone in our group can always be together and support each other during preparation. </p>
<p>At the beginning, we four were all very positive, energetic and active. Tiffany found some lessons online, while Leo borrowed some books like Baron. Yuki and I collected and sorted all the materials we had. We even attended the CCA for NEC every Tuesday afternoon. This was the most impressive part in this activity, as Together Group gave me the feeling of a family.</p>
<p>Gradually, two of us started to lose confidence as other students are stronger than us in Economics. Yuki and I kept on taking classes and reading Mankind’s Principle of Economy. During this stage, I noticed that it became easier for me to understand some knowledge we learn in normal classes by Ms.Cindy.</p>
<p>Before the exam, I knew that it was almost impossible for my Together Group to get into next turn as it counted the top three marks in a group. However, I didn’t choose to give up because for a very long time I have believe that after the winter, there will always be the spring and when I do a thing, especially as a group member, I need to try my best to finish it because it is my responsibility and if I do, I can grow stronger. Several night before the exam, I stayed up late until mid-night and wrote a pile of notes. When collecting them after exam, strong sense of pride and achievement. </p>
<p>I haven’t get the result of the exam. However, I believed that everything will be well although we may not get into next turn to take part in the NEC China Finals, because I have done my best and insisted the belief in my heart for years.</p>
<p>From NEC Preliminary, I got to know that when I decide to do something, it is better for me to finish it without distractions, because when I act as this, I will become stronger and stronger. </p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>My name is Yiran Dai. Others call me Sylvia. I am a student in Grade 10 at Nanjing Foreign Languages School International Curriculum Center.</p>
<p>I have spent 15 years living in Nanjing, which is my hometown. I have always longed to see the wide world outside Nanjing, so I have travelled gone to other places all over the world. For example, I visited the U.K. in 2017 with my friends. I can’t forget the beautiful views of the Thames. In addition, I enjoy playing the piano and the violin. Photography and reading interest me as well. </p>
<p>My family consists of my parents, two cats and me. My cats are fond of playing with me. Sometimes, I feed homeless cats in my school and community. My family regard me as an outgoing and kind girl.</p>
<p>I have a wide circle of friends. I organize activities and events for my class and school, such as the New Year Gala in my school. When we are stuck for fresh ideas, new ones come to me very quickly. When we face difficult problems, I help to come up with a solution quickly. They call me “the most creative female in the world”. When I asked my close friends why they had made friends with me, almost everyone told me that it was because I have a strong sense of ceremony. I remember their birthdays, anniversaries and important events and send messages to them. Additionally, I built friendships with my Physics and Economics teachers. They always praise me for my accurate self-assessment and efforts made in each subject.</p>
<p>I am really proud of myself in two respects. Firstly, as I mentioned above, I am capable of organising large events. I am happy to act as a leader. Secondly, although I am always in a hurry every day, I spare some time to listen patiently to others and to talk to them.</p>
<p>This is me, a girl who is both thoughtful and sensitive.</p>

    <title>Thinking on One Two Three…Infinite</title>
    <url>/2021/01/26/Thinking%20on%20One%20Two%20Three%E2%80%A6Infinite%20/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>What is infinity? In wikipedia, infinity represents something that is boundless or endless, or else something that is larger than any real or natural number. </p>
<p>To be honest, I don’t understand every detail in the book. Although this book was written about a half century ago, some knowledge is not the most famous at the moment. However, this book is still not out of date actually. </p>
<p>To begin with counting, or maybe how to count, the author describes the ways which the ancient people followed to count. Meantime, he introduces some examples of enormous numbers. At last, he tells us several interesting definitions, like prime number and imaginary number, and famous theorem, like Fermat’s last theorem. </p>
<p>In the second chapter, the author introduces the four-dimensional space. This part becomes more difficult for me to understand as I have a poor ability of imagining. However, some interesting things attracted my attention. The four colour theorem reminds me of the geography lesson which I had during junior high school. That is the first time for me to get to know something about Topology. </p>
<p>The most unforgettable thing in the first two parts is an annotation given by the translator. The annotation is given during the author describe the four colour theorem. It says “This theorem has been proved during 1970s by the computer.” </p>
<p>What does this mean?</p>
<p>We all know that science has been developed rapidly in the past century. More and more theorems help people extend the science research. It becomes more difficult for non-professional people to learn, although in modern society, more convenient ways have been designed to learn new knowledge. Online reading is a good example. It is worth noting that, in these years, the things which have been develop do not only include science and technology, but also the ability of people to learn. This may be another thing the author want to tell us. That is the ability of people to learn is infinity as well. Humans have great potential energy to develop further in all the fields.</p>

    <title>Thinking on The Fuzzy and The Techie</title>
    <url>/2021/02/14/Thinking%20on%20The%20Fuzzy%20and%20The%20Techie/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>This book mainly talks about the relationship between the Liberal Arts and digital world.</p>
<p>What is the Liberal Arts? Liberal arts generally covers four areas including the natural sciences, social sciences, arts and humanities. At present, there are some liberal arts colleges in the U.S.A. which are undergraduate institutions of high education, for example the Wellesley College. From my point of view, liberal arts plays an essential role in our society. First of all, liberal arts can also be described as “psychology”. All the liberal arts majors aim to research the way in which humans consider things and the influence on the society caused by these consideration. From example, Economics is the study which looks for the mentality of the consumers, producers and governments in a specific market. In addition, liberal arts also represents interdisciplinary study and research. A liberal arts education encourages students to integrates different areas of study, making students to explore a variety of subjects. This results in students can consider one problem from multiple perspectives.</p>
<p>What is STEM? STEM stands for science, technology, engineering and maths. These subjects promote the development of technology which has a wider meaning than the technology in STEM. This will result in a better living standard. For example, it is possible for us to print a house in a relative short time with a 3D printer which requires a long time with plenty of workers to finish.</p>
<p>I must point out that STEM and liberal arts coincide in some areas. For example, they both cover the natural science which include chemistry, physics and other subjects. </p>
<p>The first thing I want to talk about is the interdisciplinary studies. This is defined as the combination of two or more academic disciplines into one activity. When it happens, something is created by thinking across boundaries between different subjects. At present, a variety of interdisciplinary studies appears in our society for example the PPE ( Politics, Philosophy and Economics) and HSPS (Human, Social, and Political Sciences). During interdisciplinary studies, students can easily develop the skills of critical thinking, communication, creative problem solving, self-expression, innovative research and lifelong learning. This can promote the digital worlds as when we start an Internet company, everything needs to be considered detailedly without any mistakes. These skills will work. The study of liberal arts is mainly the interdisciplinary studies. To sum up, from the aspect of the interdisciplinary studies and the skills, the liberal arts is able to promote digital world.</p>
<p>The nest thing drawing my attention is the replacement by the technology. In the book, the author describes the situation in which the some workers are replaced by the technology, for example, the proportion of farmers has decreased a lot during the past century in America because of the development of automation. I still remembered the words which were said by my junior high school head teacher Mr. Cao. He said that in the future, we needed to concentrate in one areas to be more professional, because this could help us avoid being replaced by others. With the development of technology, the main problem has turned from replacement by the other workers to replacement by the technology. The times changed. Our competitor has changed from people to machines. I don’t mean that we need to reject all the technology. The most important thing is how to balance the relationship between technology and workers. From my point of view, overuse of technology may result in an increase in unemployment. Unskilled people may find it more and more difficult to earn a living. Skilled people must be more and more professional to keep their job. However, liberal arts can solve this problem in some ways. If everyone takes liberal arts, they will learn to think independently and critically. This results in that everyone has clear direction of self-development. Digital world can progress better in such social environment.</p>
<p>The last thing is people oriented. Why is liberal arts important? Except the reasons mentioned above, another vital reason is that liberal arts is kind of human based. In modern society, the technology can work out a variety of solutions of a problem, but it is difficult for them to choose, because the choices are made with consideration for a lot of factors, not only the costs and opportunity costs, as our society is made up of over seven billion people. A company which has workers can not survive without people oriented. After a long-time squeeze, people may do some crazy things. Everything will change, if the company is people oriented, Google discovered that if bosses greeted workers enthusiastically in the morning, the productivity would show an increase. </p>
<p>In conclusion, the liberal arts plays a positive role in the Digital World. However, I think liberal arts can influence all the fields optimistically because of its features. </p>
