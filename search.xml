    <title>SOME RECORDS ON NEC</title>
    <url>/2020/12/21/AR%202020-12-21NEC/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Last Sunday afternoon, 2020 21st Dec, I finished my NEC exam. </p>
<p>I have prepared for the exam since I decided to take part in it. When the words ‘EXAM IS OVER’ appeared on my screen, I was a little bit disappointed because there were many questions which I found I could not do anything with. </p>
<p>About four months ago, when I talked to my Economics teacher Ms.Cindy, I heard about NEC for the first time. She told me that NEC is National Economics Challenge and advantages and disadvantages of it. I decided to take part in it as I discovered that I am really interested in Economics.</p>
<p>Then, I discussed with my friends. We founded a group called ‘Together Group’ because we hoped that everyone in our group can always be together and support each other during preparation. </p>
<p>At the beginning, we four were all very positive, energetic and active. Tiffany found some lessons online, while Leo borrowed some books like Baron. Yuki and I collected and sorted all the materials we had. We even attended the CCA for NEC every Tuesday afternoon. This was the most impressive part in this activity, as Together Group gave me the feeling of a family.</p>
<p>Gradually, two of us started to lose confidence as other students are stronger than us in Economics. Yuki and I kept on taking classes and reading Mankind’s Principle of Economy. During this stage, I noticed that it became easier for me to understand some knowledge we learn in normal classes by Ms.Cindy.</p>
<p>Before the exam, I knew that it was almost impossible for my Together Group to get into next turn as it counted the top three marks in a group. However, I didn’t choose to give up because for a very long time I have believe that after the winter, there will always be the spring and when I do a thing, especially as a group member, I need to try my best to finish it because it is my responsibility and if I do, I can grow stronger. Several night before the exam, I stayed up late until mid-night and wrote a pile of notes. When collecting them after exam, strong sense of pride and achievement. </p>
<p>I haven’t get the result of the exam. However, I believed that everything will be well although we may not get into next turn to take part in the NEC China Finals, because I have done my best and insisted the belief in my heart for years.</p>
<p>From NEC Preliminary, I got to know that when I decide to do something, it is better for me to finish it without distractions, because when I act as this, I will become stronger and stronger. </p>

    <title>SOME RECORDS ON AMC and AIME</title>
    <url>/2021/04/14/AR%202021-04-14AMC/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>On 5th and 11th February, I finished my two AMC exams.</p>
<p>AMC is American Mathematics Competition. It is one of the most popular and welcomed maths competition all over the world. During primary school, I used to take part in AMC8 and receive a relative high score(Top 2.5%). As a result, after attending senior high school, AMC became one of my after-class activities as well, because I wanted to challenge myself through it. </p>
<p>During my process of preparation, I felt a little bit lonely from time to time, as there were only a few students in my class choosing to try AMC12 which is beyond the current syllabus.</p>
<p>I tried to talk with August who prepared for AMC12 too, about the exam preparing. We discussed questions from time to time after that. Now, we are good friends. This is the most impressive part of the activity. </p>
<p>I started to understand that although we may compete with each other during the competition, it is still important and possible for us to cooperate, as a result of friendship. Competition is more than competing. August and I received satisfied scores. I got 103.5points in AMC10A and 117points in AMC12B. </p>
<p>Additionally, through AMC, one thing has become clearer than before. The process of improving, challenging and studying may be lonely because everyone makes different decision during this period. For example, my best friend Estella chose to forgo AMC as she wanted to take part in FBLA more. Another example is that during the last preparing day, August and I still had a lot of things which we had not learnt and understood. We chose to study different areas.</p>
<p>From my point of view, the aloneness is one of the lessons we need to learn during our studying time. </p>
<p>Fortunately, I got the chance to take part in AIME(America Invitational Mathematics Examination). However, something unexpected happened. The date of AIME was conflicted with my school IGCSE mock examination. I said to myself several time, “Mock is more important as it is the first time for me to experience international examinations hold by CAIE and mock exam will be the source of GPA of this semester.” Every time the sense of not convinced also came to my heart as it really took me hours and hours learning maths knowledge and going through past papers. </p>
<p>Finally, I decided to give up preparing for AIME to save time for mock exams. After handing in my AIME paper, I got to know that this time I must have been failed to achieve anything. It was near 8 p.m. when AIME was done. Block 1912 opposite my school was still full of music sounds and colourful lights. Suddenly, one concept which I learnt in Economics came to my mind——opportunity cost and made me feel relived.</p>
<p>Everyone has limited time and energy, but I always long for finishing everything which is unattainable and impossible. As a result, it is necessary for me to make a decision on what to do. Opportunity cost is the next best choice foregone when making a decision. I still remember the words which were said by my Economics teacher Ms. Cindy when I told her that I would switch my future major from Physics to Economics. She said that, “Every decision or choice has an opportunity cost. I simply hope that you can consider the thing carefully before making a decision.”</p>
<p>Perhaps to Estella, she though FBLA was more important than AMC so she made such a decision that high prize was rewarded to her by FBLA but not so good performance was shown by her in AMC. To me, I still hope to achieve higher marks in IGCSE instead of AIME.</p>
<p>To sum up, I will always remember AMC and AIME of this year. They provides me with a chance to experience the concept of opportunity costs by myself instead of leaving it only as a piece of knowledge in my Economics books. </p>
<p>Meantime, after seeing the lights and hearing the sounds from Block 1912, I am not regretted about my decision anymore, although a total of only 4 marks was achieved by me in AIME, because I still realised that life sucks, so it may be better for me to be cute and enjoy and try to get understand the tastes of life more, instead of giving myself too much press to spend time seeing the around world.</p>

    <title>SOME RECORDS ON Physics Bowl</title>
    <url>/2021/04/15/AR%202021-04-15Physics%20Bowl/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>On 27th March, around two o’clock in the afternoon, I finished 2021 Physics Bowl.</p>
<p>That was a nice afternoon which is windy and cloudy. The paper was not very hard as the Electromagnetism didn’t appear too many times which is my drawback among all pieces of knowledge. The boy sitting on my left, finished his paper very quickly and seemed to be very confident about his answers.</p>
<p>I was a little bit upset that day. Two things were always on my mind.</p>
<p>To be honest, during the long preparation for Physics Bowl, I gave up half way instead of insisting on training past papers and getting through the book after class. I still remembered the first lesson of Physics Bowl taken by me at the beginning of the first semester of Senior1. During that time, Physics was my favourite subject and I even set it as my target major in the university. However, I started to learn more about both Physics and Economics. Economics is a new subject to me which I refused to study before entry of senior high school but was deeply attracted after getting to understand some basic knowledge. By contrast, it was unbelievable that it began hard for me to understand the complicated concepts in Physics which ran out all my patience and interest. With further study in Economics competition, more time was devoted to Economics instead of Physics. It was a process that happened during a long period, but I still remembered clearly some small moments like I was almost driven crazy by Physics for the first time. From then on, I knew that the story between Physics and I may be near the ending. Another thing happened is that I did some program study those days and read more books about both Nature Science and Social Science especially Economics. A strange feeling of thirsty of concentrating more on Economics came to my heart due to the books I read. I talked to my parents, counsellor and Economics teacher several times. They all hoped that I could insist on what I really love. </p>
<p>AMC teaches me the real meaning of opportunity costs. Physics Bowl may teach me something about giving up. </p>
<p>Many teachers say I am a girl who has a strong demand for perfection, because it is common for me to take part in all the meaningful activities and play an active role in finishing tasks, in order to get satisfying result, even if I dislike the activities or lack time. During the preparation, everyday I was so busy to deal with every details in my life as many events had similar date, that it was difficult for me to calm down and go through the day again, so I decided to give up something to chill myself and reflect more. </p>
<p>I decided to give up Physics Bowl as a result of a lack of incentive of further study due to decreasing interest in Physics. Maybe we can regard this decision as a kind of releasing myself. </p>
<p>I would always be thankful for Physics Bowl as it helped me to discover that maybe it is so suitable for me to spend the rest of time learning Physics but Economics. Also, it provided me with a chance to think about giving up which is a thing I had never though about before. I don’t think that giving up equals to escaping. It is that choose to not choose something in our life because we may hope to choose other things. This is kind of admiration of being ourselves.</p>

    <title>Some records on IEO(International Economics Olympiad)</title>
    <url>/2021/04/29/AR%202021-04-29IEO/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I took part in International Economics Olympiad China Open Round on 11th April.</p>
<p>It was two weeks after my mock exams and three days after Euclid Mathematics Contest. Meanwhile, as the semester was near the end, most subjects final projects which had great influence on my GPA had the deadline at that week, including Economics, Business, Music and Visual Art.</p>
<p>Working to deadline is always my preference. However, after the mock exam, when going through the schedule, a reality came to me which was that the work was so much that it was almost impossible for me to deal with in just one week. I needed to make a plan ahead instead of missing deadline or finishing things curtly.</p>
<p>The plan was like that on Monday I needed to finish the outliner of Business project which would take me around 1 hour and the first part of Economics mind map which would take me about 2 hours. I thought I could finish everything perfectly and with high quality with the help of the plan. </p>
<p>However, the truth is that as it was difficult for me to estimate the time needed accurately, the plan was not completed at the first day, because Business outliner took me too much time. Every time when the time was not enough I chose to give up IEO.</p>
<p>I still understood that IEO was very important, because it is not a personal competition, but a team competition. I need to spend time preparing it as it is essential for me to be responsible to my teammate no matter whether they are responsible to me. The only thing I could do was to ask Economics teacher Ms. Grace for help. </p>
<p>I talked to Ms. Grace and asked her whether she could provide us with several office hours to go through the syllabus. She agreed. As Ms. Grace is an Economics teacher, she does not know about Business and Finance(30% of points were about Business and Finance). I hoped to read A-Level Business book to make sure I can solve the problems during the exam, but there was too much knowledge and too short time to finish. I went to my Business teacher Ms. Cindy. She provided me with a summarised book and several advices. The night before the exam, I spent about 8 hours finishing reading and understanding the book until 3 a.m.. I do not praise what I have done because enough sleeping is exactly important for us. I am still happy with is, as the result of discovering how interesting Business and Finance are and having the courage to challenging myself. </p>
<p>After finishing the exam, I knew that although I may not do IEO well and get low marks, I had tried my best and would not be guilty for not doing well. The result did not mean too much because the experiences and the feelings of challenging were more important. </p>
<p>To sum up, IEO taught me two lessons. The first one is that sometimes we maybe can not follow the plan, so it is important for us to both leave some spare time when making plan and record why we can not finish it to make sure the same thing will not happen for a second time. In addition, follow what you believe and you will find yourself improved through this process. Meanwhile, the whole universe will come to help you when you really want to achieve a thing, so you will gain more, such as the friendship between Ms. Cindy and I.</p>

    <title>Thinking on 25 Things You Need to Know About the Future</title>
    <url>/2020/12/16/RR%202020-12-16%2025%20things%20you%20need%20to%20know%20about%20the%20future/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I was inspired by a book called <strong>25</strong> <strong>things you need to know about the future</strong> written by Christopher Barnatt to discuss several details about the future development. </p>
<p>According to the two part I have read, the author holds the opinion that the new technology can help us save and reuse resources in the future and the aim is to reduce loss of energy during production. However, from my point of view, I don’t deny the author’s opinion, but we may need to pay more attention to sustainable development, like reusing resources as much as possible, clean energy like hydrogen energy and less pollution caused during production and daily life. Reducing loss may be not useful in long run as the total resource we owning is invariable, unless we achieve to use the resource as efficiently as over a large proportion. By contrast, reusing resources can consider the resource we owning is unlimited because we can always reuse them if they are used in correct ways. In addition, clean energy and less pollution supplement each other. Clean energy can reduce the cost of cleaning pollution and the waste caused during coal-based production. </p>
<p>As Hegel says, ‘but what experience and history teach is this – that nations and governments have never learned anything from history or acted upon any lessons they might have drawn from it.’ He means people can never go into a same river. Because we are at different time and meeting different problems, it is hard for us to follow the lessons which the history taught us. Both the author and I are analysing the trends of development. No one can judge who is correct or who is wrong through the history. The only thing we can do is to leave the right to judge to time.</p>
<p>The third part of the book has a meaningful name which can be regarded as a paronomasia. </p>
<p>The name is <strong>Fuelling the Third Millennium</strong>. The first layer of meaning is to analyse new resources or new ways to transforming energy in the following years to play the role of fuel, just like the oil in the past two millennium, while the second is to give some support to help and encourage the third millennium become better and better.</p>
<p>This part made me to think about a question — why do people create new things? Or I can explain it as what makes people to keep working instead of remaining unchanged? I think the answer is that people always desire something new to make the life much better and easier or some bad situations drive people to change. These two conditions differ from each other apparently. The first situation is to act spontaneously, consciously and initiatively. Compared with the first one, the second one is acting passively. From my point of view, the first situation is better than the second one, as the people realise themselves and own a heart of getting stronger. </p>
<p>Sometimes, some problems appear and then we take action. This is also kind of acting passively. However, if we can converse the way which we consider the world from being asked or forced to do something into acting spontaneously to improve ourselves and make a little contribution to the whole world to complete our own value of life, the result will not as bad as acting passively. Some changes will happen. </p>
<p>During the process of developing, situations discussed above will happen, but not limited to this. We may fail, just as the author wrote in the book, for example several rockets exploded. The loss of people’s lives and equipments can not be ignored. Anyway, the failure has been caused. The only thing we can do is to learn something from the failure and consider why we failed and how to be better next time. This is the thing that all the scientists who are trying to develop new ways to conserve the energy are doing now. They learn from the experience from the elderly and use the knowledge to do more experiments. They may fail as the elderly. They keep trying instead of giving up easily.</p>
<p>The last two parts of the books talk about two topics. One is computer science and inorganic life, while the other is future medicine. Although the author highly praised and held high expectation in these two fields, I still think these two topics can both be regarded as Pandora’s Box. </p>
<p>I never doubt that the computer science and medicine can play a positive, irreplaceable and essential role in human beings’ development. By contrast, I am worrying whether we have abilities to control the intelligent creatures designed and created by us. I read a short science fiction novel <strong>t**</strong>he** <strong>Bookshop at the End of the Universe</strong> written by Jiang Bo. The novel tells a story that after hundreds of years, humans can learn knowledge by technology instead of studying and reading books. Everyone is almost under the computers’ control as we can not think and study. This is kind of horrible and unacceptable. However, the significance of science fiction novel is to predict one result of development.</p>
<p>After considering the result of development, moral philosophy should also be discussed. Can we regard robots as humans, if they can think independently? Can we regard the knowledge which we get in other ways instead of learning by ourselves as the knowledge we own? Should people live an infinite lifespan? Everything is beyond the knowledge we have at present. It still requires a long time to complete the system of moral philosophy. In my opinion, things in the future, even tomorrow, are uncertain. As a result, these two parts of the book can be looked upon as discussion about whether we are ready to develop new technology. This comes back to the first part we discussed about this book above and makes a logic circle which might be intricate nowadays. </p>
<p>I really like this book, although the author and I have different opinions in several point. Additionally, it still is definitely shocked that some predictions in the books have become reality. The author predicted that a kind of virus would spread all over the world someday. This came true in 2020 as everyone knows that COVID-19 spread almost every corner on the Earth.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I have finished read this small book which predicts future. In some ways, I think this book is more likely to be a prediction on future technology, than future. Many points in the book make sense. We can only see a small part of the development of AI, Internet, biotechnology, nanotechnology and quantum physics. There is still a long way for us to go to discover how to put these things into use.</p>
<p>Today, many people merely consider their own benefit instead of owning the awareness of developing together. The society is not equal. The wealth you have may be able to decide how long you can live and how fast your wealth will grow. Gaps between people will become larger and larger, as a result, the competition will be more and more drastic. From my point of view, the solution is hidden in social science.</p>
<p>Future is about technology, but is more than it. It is more about the human beings and the society, including humanitarian things and a variety of meaningful things needed to be considered by us. </p>

    <title>Thinking on One Two Three…Infinite</title>
    <url>/2021/01/26/RR%202021-01-26Thinking%20on%20One%20Two%20Three%E2%80%A6Infinite%20/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>What is infinity? In wikipedia, infinity represents something that is boundless or endless, or else something that is larger than any real or natural number. </p>
<p>To be honest, I don’t understand every detail in the book. Although this book was written about a half century ago, some knowledge is not the most famous at the moment. However, this book is still not out of date actually. </p>
<p>To begin with counting, or maybe how to count, the author describes the ways which the ancient people followed to count. Meantime, he introduces some examples of enormous numbers. At last, he tells us several interesting definitions, like prime number and imaginary number, and famous theorem, like Fermat’s last theorem. </p>
<p>In the second chapter, the author introduces the four-dimensional space. This part becomes more difficult for me to understand as I have a poor ability of imagining. However, some interesting things attracted my attention. The four colour theorem reminds me of the geography lesson which I had during junior high school. That is the first time for me to get to know something about Topology. </p>
<p>The most unforgettable thing in the first two parts is an annotation given by the translator. The annotation is given during the author describe the four colour theorem. It says “This theorem has been proved during 1970s by the computer.” </p>
<p>What does this mean?</p>
<p>We all know that science has been developed rapidly in the past century. More and more theorems help people extend the science research. It becomes more difficult for non-professional people to learn, although in modern society, more convenient ways have been designed to learn new knowledge. Online reading is a good example. It is worth noting that, in these years, the things which have been develop do not only include science and technology, but also the ability of people to learn. This may be another thing the author want to tell us. That is the ability of people to learn is infinity as well. Humans have great potential energy to develop further in all the fields.</p>

    <title>Thinking on The Fuzzy and The Techie</title>
    <url>/2021/02/14/RR%202021-02-14Thinking%20on%20The%20Fuzzy%20and%20The%20Techie/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>This book mainly talks about the relationship between the Liberal Arts and digital world.</p>
<p>What is the Liberal Arts? Liberal arts generally covers four areas including the natural sciences, social sciences, arts and humanities. At present, there are some liberal arts colleges in the U.S.A. which are undergraduate institutions of high education, for example the Wellesley College. From my point of view, liberal arts plays an essential role in our society. First of all, liberal arts can also be described as “psychology”. All the liberal arts majors aim to research the way in which humans consider things and the influence on the society caused by these consideration. From example, Economics is the study which looks for the mentality of the consumers, producers and governments in a specific market. In addition, liberal arts also represents interdisciplinary study and research. A liberal arts education encourages students to integrates different areas of study, making students to explore a variety of subjects. This results in students can consider one problem from multiple perspectives.</p>
<p>What is STEM? STEM stands for science, technology, engineering and maths. These subjects promote the development of technology which has a wider meaning than the technology in STEM. This will result in a better living standard. For example, it is possible for us to print a house in a relative short time with a 3D printer which requires a long time with plenty of workers to finish.</p>
<p>I must point out that STEM and liberal arts coincide in some areas. For example, they both cover the natural science which include chemistry, physics and other subjects. </p>
<p>The first thing I want to talk about is the interdisciplinary studies. This is defined as the combination of two or more academic disciplines into one activity. When it happens, something is created by thinking across boundaries between different subjects. At present, a variety of interdisciplinary studies appears in our society for example the PPE ( Politics, Philosophy and Economics) and HSPS (Human, Social, and Political Sciences). During interdisciplinary studies, students can easily develop the skills of critical thinking, communication, creative problem solving, self-expression, innovative research and lifelong learning. This can promote the digital worlds as when we start an Internet company, everything needs to be considered detailedly without any mistakes. These skills will work. The study of liberal arts is mainly the interdisciplinary studies. To sum up, from the aspect of the interdisciplinary studies and the skills, the liberal arts is able to promote digital world.</p>
<p>The nest thing drawing my attention is the replacement by the technology. In the book, the author describes the situation in which the some workers are replaced by the technology, for example, the proportion of farmers has decreased a lot during the past century in America because of the development of automation. I still remembered the words which were said by my junior high school head teacher Mr. Cao. He said that in the future, we needed to concentrate in one areas to be more professional, because this could help us avoid being replaced by others. With the development of technology, the main problem has turned from replacement by the other workers to replacement by the technology. The times changed. Our competitor has changed from people to machines. I don’t mean that we need to reject all the technology. The most important thing is how to balance the relationship between technology and workers. From my point of view, overuse of technology may result in an increase in unemployment. Unskilled people may find it more and more difficult to earn a living. Skilled people must be more and more professional to keep their job. However, liberal arts can solve this problem in some ways. If everyone takes liberal arts, they will learn to think independently and critically. This results in that everyone has clear direction of self-development. Digital world can progress better in such social environment.</p>
<p>The last thing is people oriented. Why is liberal arts important? Except the reasons mentioned above, another vital reason is that liberal arts is kind of human based. In modern society, the technology can work out a variety of solutions of a problem, but it is difficult for them to choose, because the choices are made with consideration for a lot of factors, not only the costs and opportunity costs, as our society is made up of over seven billion people. A company which has workers can not survive without people oriented. After a long-time squeeze, people may do some crazy things. Everything will change, if the company is people oriented, Google discovered that if bosses greeted workers enthusiastically in the morning, the productivity would show an increase. </p>
<p>In conclusion, the liberal arts plays a positive role in the Digital World. However, I think liberal arts can influence all the fields optimistically because of its features. </p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>My name is Yiran Dai. Others call me Sylvia. I am a student in Grade 10 at Nanjing Foreign Languages School International Curriculum Center.</p>
<p>I have spent 15 years living in Nanjing, which is my hometown. I have always longed to see the wide world outside Nanjing, so I have travelled gone to other places all over the world. For example, I visited the U.K. in 2017 with my friends. I can’t forget the beautiful views of the Thames. In addition, I enjoy playing the piano and the violin. Photography and reading interest me as well. </p>
<p>My family consists of my parents, two cats and me. My cats are fond of playing with me. Sometimes, I feed homeless cats in my school and community. My family regard me as an outgoing and kind girl.</p>
<p>I have a wide circle of friends. I organize activities and events for my class and school, such as the New Year Gala in my school. When we are stuck for fresh ideas, new ones come to me very quickly. When we face difficult problems, I help to come up with a solution quickly. They call me “the most creative female in the world”. When I asked my close friends why they had made friends with me, almost everyone told me that it was because I have a strong sense of ceremony. I remember their birthdays, anniversaries and important events and send messages to them. Additionally, I built friendships with my Physics and Economics teachers. They always praise me for my accurate self-assessment and efforts made in each subject.</p>
<p>I am really proud of myself in two respects. Firstly, as I mentioned above, I am capable of organising large events. I am happy to act as a leader. Secondly, although I am always in a hurry every day, I spare some time to listen patiently to others and to talk to them.</p>
<p>This is me, a girl who is both thoughtful and sensitive.</p>
