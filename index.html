        <p>What is future? In Wikipedia, future stands for the time after the present. </p>
<p>We can not know exactly what will happen tomorrow which is included in future, but we can discover the trends. Sometimes the prediction may not happen in the future or even against the future. Compared with prediction, trends are more reliable as they are not baseless. We have realised the importance of understanding the possible trends. This book mainly analyse the facts which have happened and reveal trends of development in technology and science.</p>
<p>In the first part, the author discusses the end of the era of abundance, which include using up the oil, clean drinkable water, food(especially the fish) and the other resources. After this, the author talks about the next wave of industry including 3D printing, Nanotechnology, genetic engineering, synthetic biology and the vertical farm. The basic logic behind these two parts is as the era of abundance will end in the near future, we need to develop science and technology to extend the life span of human beings civilisation(if all the resource is used, human can’t survive). We can conclude the first part as ‘Why do we need to develop science?’, while the second part as ‘What have happened in industry and what may happen’.</p>
<p>According to the two part I have read, I do not deny that the new technology can help us save and reuse resources in the future and the aim is to reduce loss of energy during production. From my point of view, we may need to pay more attention to sustainable development, like the reusing resources as much as possible, clean energy and less pollution. Reducing loss may be not useful in long run as the total resource we owning is invariable. By contrast, reusing resources can consider the resource we owning is unlimited because we can always reuse them if they are used in correct ways. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>As Hegel says, ‘But what experience and history teach is this – that nations and governments have never learned anything from history or acted upon any lessons they might have drawn from it.’ </p>
</blockquote>
<p>He means people can never go into a same rive. Because we are at different time and meeting different problems, it is hard for us to follow the lessons which the history taught us. Both the author and I are analysing the trends of development. No one can judge who is correct or who is wrong through the history. The only thing I can do is to leave the right to judge to time. </p>
<hr>
<p>The third part of the book has a meaningful name which can be regarded as a paronomasia. </p>
<p>The name is <em>Fuelling the Third Millennium</em>. The first layer of meaning is to analyse new resources or new ways to transforming energy in the following years to play the role of fuel, just like the oil in the past two millennium, while the second is to give some support to help and encourage the third millennium become better and better.</p>
<p>In this part, the author mainly talks about several eco-friendly ways to converse the energy. Everything has energy and the conversion of energy makes the objects move. As a result, the topic of this part is very important in the discussion of the future, from my point of view. This made me to think about a question — why do people create new things? Or I can explain it as what makes people to keep working instead of remaining unchanged? I think the answer is that people always desire something new to make the life much better and easier or some bad situations drive people to change. These two conditions differ from each other apparently. The first situation is to act spontaneously, consciously and initiatively. Compared with the first one, the second one is acting passively. From my point of view, the first situation is better than the second one, as the people realise themselves and own a heart of getting stronger. </p>
<p>Sometimes, some problems appear and then we take action. This is also kind of acting passively. However, if we can converse the way which we consider the world from being asked or forced to do something into acting spontaneously to improve ourselves and make a little contribution to the whole world to complete our own value of life, the result will not as bad as acting passively. Some changes will happen. </p>
<p>During the process of developing, situations discussed above will happen, but not limited to this. We may fail, just as the author wrote in the book, for example several rockets exploded. The loss of people’s lives and equipments can not be ignored. Anyway, the failure has been caused. The only thing we can do is to learn something from the failure and consider why we failed and how to be better next time. </p>
<p>This is the thing that all the scientists who are trying to develop new ways to conserve the energy are doing now. They learn from the experience from the elderly and use the knowledge to do more experiments. They may fail as the elderly. They keep trying instead of giving up easily.</p>
<p>The third part, as far as I am concerned, is not simply talking about conservation, but also a spirit of human which stand for never giving up and keeping acting spontaneously, consciously and initiatively.</p>
