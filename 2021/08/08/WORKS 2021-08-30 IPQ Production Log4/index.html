        <p><strong><em>\</em>Is my project following my original plan? How has my plan developed?**</strong></p>
<p>My project followed my planning table mostly. The changes in methodology influenced several stages. As a result, I have changed the details in the planning table. I think this is adequate. </p>
<p>I. Successes<br>Recently I have managed to finish the literature table and literature review. The table helps me use the information more quickly in the future. I have also talked to my supervisor again to check whether I can use my output. Also, I read the annual report from ICAO ( International Civil Aviation Organisation) about the situation of the whole industry in 2020. I selected several data which I thought was helpful. These data will help me work out the current situation of the aviation industry to respond to my first question.<br>Also, I read the annual report from United Airlines’ website. I found the income statement, cash flow statement and balance sheet.</p>
<p>II. Failure<br>The data is available. However, there is still some data that I need to use in the part of SPACE Matrix being not available. For example, the price elasticity of demand needs to use a questionnaire. However, I do not know the consumers of United Airlines, so I can not carry out the questionnaire to achieve it.<br>Meanwhile, I have some difficulties analysing them, although I have some resources for analysing. I keep reading books, like the textbook of A-Level Business Study, to make sure that there are fewer mistakes in my report. </p>
<p><strong><em>\</em>My summary of the comments and advice from my supervisor (and specialist consultant if applicable).**</strong></p>
<p>My supervisor provided me with the most positive comments. She said that I had followed my planning table well. My essay plan was suitable, which means it is reasonable and well organised. Also, she said that my changes in methodology were correct because using a single method would help me have more clear logic in the report. Also, using three or two methods may make me have too much load, which means I may not achieve the report before the deadline. This change would help me pay more attention to the strategy as well. </p>
<p>Also, she mentioned the presentation I would do in the future. She suggested that I start preparing for it, including the slides and what I want to show. Also, as I am not good at giving a presentation, I may start to practise.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I may start to write the discussion part, especially the former part about the current situation of the aviation industry and United Airlines.</p>
<p>I also talked to a specialist. She thought my report had been very logical and well organised. I explained the SPACE Matrix to her. She thought this method was more suitable and reasonable than my previous choices, including SWOT and PEST analysis. However, she suggested that I talk to my supervisor to determine whether some indicators in SPACE Matrix can be combined or deleted. This change would make my report clearer.</p>
<p><strong><em>\</em>Modifications I have made as a result of my discussion with my supervisor at this stage (and specialist consultant if applicable).**</strong></p>
<p>After talking to my supervisor and specialist, I began to research each indicator of the SPACE Matrix. I found some scholars said that when they were using the SPACE Matrix, they would provide each indicator with a weight based on the importance of each indicator to the industry. Also, they sometimes even ignore some indicators. However, I am not the authority in the aviation industry, and there were no previous researches using SPACE Matrix in the aviation industry. I finally decided to not follow the instruction from the specialist.</p>
<p>Also, I changed my planning table again to make the time for completing the discussion part earlier. After that, I can have more time for correcting what I have written and changing the details. </p>
<p>I started to prepare for my presentation. I have decided that it will contain why I choose this topic, how I developed my report and what I have found. Also, there will be a question and answer part. After finishing writing it, I will go over my report to make sure I can answer the questions clearly and logically. </p>
<p><strong><em>\</em>My final title, aims and objectives.**</strong></p>
<p>My final title is —— Analyse the influence of COVID-19 on the aviation industry and provide suggestions on future development using SPACE Matrix analysis. This title allows me to concentrate in United Airlines and its strategy. My project will be in the form of a 5000-word discussion-based report, including an introduction, literature review, methodology, discussion, and conclusion. This report will analyse the current situation of the aviation industry and United Airlines using all kinds of data from annual reports and previous research and evaluate the strategy for United Airlines to take using SPACE Matrix based on the background of COVID-19. </p>
<p><strong><em>\</em>My planned next steps to achieve my project’s aims and objectives.**</strong></p>
<p>My next steps are to complete the discussion part of my report, as I have finished writing the introduction and literature review before the deadline I set in the planning table. I also plan to create a presentation before the end of the summer holiday. I will go through all the information I obtained for discussion. This action will help me work out the discussion. I plan to finish it by 20th August. After that, I will spend two days writing the methodology and conclusion. Then, I plan to finish my presentation, including the slides and lecture, before 24th August. I will still spend several days on my Production Log before 30th August. As I am doing other things, including summer school, at the same time, there may be slight changes in the deadline date. I will complete everything before 31st August. </p>
