<li><p>Gross Domestic Production(GDP)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Definition: GDP is the total market value of all final goods and services produced in a country in a give year</p>
</li>
<li><p>Components</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Consumption</p>
<ul>
<li>This refers to the total spending on goods and services by individuals and households in an economy</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Government spending</p>
<ul>
<li>This is the total consumption and investment expenditure of the government(ignoring payments made without any corresponding output, eg. unemployment benefit)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Investment</p>
<ul>
<li>This refers to the capital spending of firms used to increase production and to expand the economy’s productive capacity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Net export</p>
<ul>
<li>Net export=export earnings-import revenue</li>
<li>Export earnings measures the monetary value of all exports sold to foreign buyers</li>
<li>Import revenue measure the monetary value of all imports</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Classification</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Nominal GDP</p>
<ul>
<li>It is GDP valued in terms of the prices operative at that time</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Real GDP</p>
<ul>
<li>It is GDP at constant prices and so adjusted for inflation</li>
<li>Economists calculate it by multiplying nominal GDP with the price index in the base year, divided by the price index in the current year</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>GDP per head</p>
<ul>
<li>GDP per head=real GDP/population</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Calculating</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ways of calculating</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Output</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding up the output produced by all the industries in the country. Economists include the ‘value added’ by each firm at each stage of production</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Income</p>
<ul>
<li>Include all the incomes which have been earned in producing the country’s output</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Expenditure</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding up all the expenditure on the country’s finished output. It is necessary to add exports and deduct imports</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Difficulties to calculate real GDP</p>
<ul>
<li>GPD tends to understate the true level of output due to existence of informal economy, including undeclared and non-market economies. </li>
<li>Factors that influence the size of the informal economy includes：<br>number of activities that are declared illegal; tax rates; penalties for tax evasion; number of tasks people perform for themselves; the size of subsistence agriculture</li>

<li><p>Economic Growth–Real GDP increases</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Definition: It is an increase in its output in the short run and an increase in the economy’s productive potential in the long run</p>
</li>
<li><p>Classification</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Actual economic growth</p>
<ul>
<li>Movement of a point closer with PPC–More capital and consumer goods are made</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Potential economic growth</p>
<ul>
<li>PPC shifts outwards–The economy is capable of producing more</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Causes</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Actual</p>
<ul>
<li>An increase in any components of AD may stimulate a rise in output if the economy has unused resources.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Potential</p>
<ul>
<li><p>An increase in the quantity or quality of resources</p>
<ul>
<li>Discovery of new resources</li>
<li>Investment in capitals and infrastructure</li>
<li>Technical progress</li>
<li>More and better healthcare, education and training</li>
<li>A more efficient resource allocation</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Consequences</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Advantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve living standards. Higher income levels increase people’s access to more goods and services. </li>
<li>Increase government tax revenue. The tax revenue can be used to reduce poverty and sustain the growth of the economy</li>
<li>Employment. An increase of output to achieve higher demand will make the employment rise</li>
<li>Stable price. Output increases to match higher demand, upward pressure on the price level can be avoided</li>
<li>Higher trade position. Some of the extra output may be exported.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Disadvantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Short-run opportunity costs. Resources shift from making consumer goods to capital goods and results in a decrease in living standards</li>
<li>Increase pollution and destroy wildlife habitats</li>
<li>Depletion of non-renewable resources and damage the natural environment</li>
<li>Greater stree on workers</li>
<li>Inflation. An increase in AD may results in demand-pull inflation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Recession–Real GDP decreases</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Definition: Recession occurs when real GDP declines over a period of six months or more.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Causes</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A decrease in aggregate demand</p>
<ul>
<li>Higher interest rate which discourages consumption </li>
<li>A decrease in consumer confidence</li>
<li>Lower rates of disposable income results in a fall in consumption</li>
<li>A decrease in government spending</li>
<li>A decline in the demand for exports</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>A decrease in aggregate supply</p>
<ul>
<li>A higher level of unemployment</li>
<li>Higher interest rate which discourage investment due to an increase in costs of borrowing</li>
<li>A decrease in government spending in investment and infrastructure</li>
<li>Low business confidence</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Consequences</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Advantages</p>
<ul>
<li>If recession is caused by a decrease in AD, the price level will fall</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Disadvantages</p>
<ul>
<li>If recession is caused by a decrease in AS, the price level will increase and results in inflation</li>
<li>Unemployment may rise because of a decrease in output. This will cause a decrease in living standards due to the reduction in output and incomes</li>
<li>Investment is discouraged which will endanger future economic growth</li>
<li>Tax revenue will decline so government spending may fall and increase budget deficit</li>

<h3 id="Changes"><a href="#Changes" class="headerlink" title="Changes"></a>Changes</h3><ul>
<li><p>Pattern of employment</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Industrial structure</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Performance</p>
<ul>
<li>As economies develop employment moves from the primary to the secondary and then to the tertiary sector</li>
<li>Some industry will be expanding and some will contracting. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>This requires workers to be occupationally and geographically mobile</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Proportion of women in employment</p>
<ul>
<li>Because of better social attitudes, gender discrimination is declining. Higher number and proportion of women in employment increase</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Proportion of workers in the public and private sectors</p>
<ul>
<li>As more countries are moving closer to market economy, the number and proportion of workers in public sector is declining</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Full-time and part-time work</p>
<ul>
<li>Most workers work full-time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Employed and self-employed</p>
<ul>
<li>The rate of self employment varies amongst countries.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Informal and formal economies</p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of benefits. Workers in informal economies may not have the same access to the social security benefits, employment protection and rights.</li>
<li>With the development of economy, number and proportion of workers in formal economy increases.</li>
<li>A growth in formal economy will raise the quality of employment and labour productivity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>High and low quality employment</p>
<ul>
<li><p>High quality</p>
<ul>
<li>It is skilled work which is interesting and which provides workers with the opportunity to have better non-wage factors of jobs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Low quality</p>
<ul>
<li>It is unskilled work which often does not require or provide training and does not provide good working conditions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>As an economy develops the proportion of high quality jobs tends to increase.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Flexible employment</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Global competition is putting pressure on firms to ensure that their labour force is flexible. A flexible labour force is one which adjust quickly and smoothly to changes in market conditions</p>
</li>
<li><p>Classification</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Numerical flexibility</p>
<ul>
<li>The easier it is to hire and fire workers, the more able firms are in adjusting their output in line with consumer demand</li>
<li>Increase workers’ sense of job security and employment</li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Cyclical unemployment</p>
<ul>
<li>Definition: It is prolonged and widespread unemployment during an economic recession due to falling and depressed aggregate demand</li>
<li>It is more serious than structural unemployment as potentially it can affect more workers and it is spread throughout the country</li>

<li><p>Inflation</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Definition: It is the sustained rise in the general price level in an economy over time</p>
</li>
<li><p>Causes</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Cost-push inflation</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It occurs when the price level is pushed up by increases in the costs of production. As costs are higher, producers will raise their prices to maintain their profit margins</p>
</li>
<li><p>Reasons</p>
<ul>
<li>Wages increase more than labour productivity</li>
<li>Increase in the cost of raw materials</li>
<li>Increase in indirect taxes</li>
<li>Higher cost of capital goods</li>
<li>Increase in profit margins by firms</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Demand-pull inflation</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It occurs when the price level is pulled up by an excess demand</p>
</li>
<li><p>Reasons</p>
<ul>
<li>Higher consumption, higher investment, higher government expenditure, higher net export</li>
<li>A shortage of some resources so it is not possible to produce any more output</li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Consequences</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Determinants</p>

<li>Inflation rate</li>
<li>Stability of this rate</li>
<li>Rate relative to the inflation rates in other countries</li>
<li>Reaction of the government</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Advantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Encourage firms to expand</li>
<li>Reduce the real burden of any debt</li>
<li>Prevent some workers being made redundant in a declining industry or region as they may accept their wages rising by less than inflation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Disadvantages</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Producer</p>
<ul>
<li>Menu costs are costs involved in changing prices in catalogues, price lists and slot machines</li>
<li>Shoe leather costs arise because money paid to firms will be losing its value as son as it is received. Seeking out good financial returns will involve the time and effort of firms</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>A fall in the value of money. There will be a fall in the real income and purchasing power.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Redistribute income in an unplanned way</p>
<ul>
<li>Savers will lose out from inflation because the money they saved is worth less than before. Also, this discourages saving and reduce bond which results in lower investment</li>
<li>Borrowers gain from inflation as the money they need to repay is worth less than when they initially borrowed it</li>
<li>Lenders will lose out from inflation because the money they lent out to borrowers becomes worth less than before</li>
<li>Fixed income earners and pensioners will have a fall in their real income</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Uncertainty. It makes it harder to judge right prices and plan ahead. Firms may be discouraged from investment</p>
</li>
<li><p>Harm balance of payment. If the country’s inflation rate is above that of its rivals, its products will become less price competitive so export will fall and import will increase. Unemployment may appear meanwhile</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fiscal drag. When government don’t adjust tax brackets in line with inflation, so people’s incomes are dragged into higher tax brackets and they are left with lower real disposable income</p>

</li>
<li><p>Causes</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Beneficial</p>
<ul>
<li>Advances in technology and increase in labour productivity may reduce price level. Consumers can enjoy more products and country be more internationally competitive</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Harmful</p>
<ul>
<li>A decline in AD. Consumers may expect prices to be lower so they may decrease purchase and output will decrease. Unemployment may increase.</li>

<li>Increase output and employment</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Harmful deflation</p>
<ul>
<li>A fall in demand may cause a fall in the demand for labour and increase unemployment</li>
<li>Consumers spend less so firms may have lower revenue to repay costs and liabilities. Bankruptcies may appear</li>
<li>Decrease consumer confidence so they will spend less and results in a downwards deflationary spiral</li>
<li>Real costs of debts increase. This will make consumers and firms decrease confidence</li>
<li>Government debts. Government may need to pay more unemployment benefits and have less revenue, so budget deficit may appear</li>

<ul>
<li><p>The higher the real GDP per head, the greater economic development tends to be.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Problems</p>
<ul>
<li>Inequalities in distribution of income</li>
<li>Composition of GDP should be considered</li>
<li>Economic growth can bring about problems, so other factors should also be considered</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Productivity</p>
<ul>
<li>Higher productivity will make it easier to develop</li>
<li>Foreign direct investment will increase productivity in quantity and quality of FOPs so increase the productive capacity and competitiveness, create jobs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Population growth</p>
<ul>
<li>countries with high population growth may have a high dependency ratio so government will spend more in education</li>
<li>Rapid population growth can limit any increase in real GDP as it reduces the GDP per capita.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Size of primary, secondary and tertiary sectors</p>
<ul>
<li>As an economy develops, there tends to be a shift away from reliance on primary and secondary sector production towards tertiary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Saving</p>
<ul>
<li>Due to different income, poor people can’t afford to save so the country with low average income may have low savings ratio. This will be a lack of finance for investment</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Investment</p>
<ul>
<li>Countries with low value of capital goods per worker may have low income per head</li>
<li>Countries with low savings may be hard for firms to borrow, so investment may be low and can’t contribute directly to economic development</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Education and healthcare</p>
<ul>
<li>A lack of access to or poor quality of education and healthcare will reduce living standards and low productivity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Concentration on a narrow range of exports</p>
<ul>
<li>Countries that export a narrow range of products can be adversely affected by large decrease in demand or supply</li>

<h3 id="Why-aim-for-economic-development"><a href="#Why-aim-for-economic-development" class="headerlink" title="Why aim for economic development"></a>Why aim for economic development</h3><ul>
<li>Higher real GDP, higher living standards and expansion of the range of economic and social choices</li>
<li>Have potential to raise material living standards</li>
<li>Enjoy more goods and services</li>
<li>Life expectancy may be increased and infant mortality rate may be reduced</li>
<li>Higher living standards</li>
<li>Distribution of income does not become too uneven and poverty is reduced</li>
<li>Expanding the range of economic and social choices, increasing freedom and self-esteem includes increasing access to education, healthcare and participation in the political process. This will improve the quality of lives and enhance future economic performance</li>

<li><p>High growth of population</p>
<ul>
<li>A high birth rate can result in resources being used</li>
<li>In the low run, higher birth rate increases the country’s productive potential and living standards</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>High levels of international debt</p>
<ul>
<li>Opportunity cost of repaying debt may be economic development. As poor countries may borrow heavily, a large percentage of country’s income is taken up in repaying loans</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Reliance on the export of primary products</p>
<ul>
<li>The price of primary products tends to fall so they receive less for exports and pay more for imports.</li>
<li>Consuming and rich countries use their buying power to keep down the prices</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Lack of investment in capitals and humans</p>
<ul>
<li>This may hold back the increases in productivity, introduction of new technology and international competitiveness</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Emigration of key workers</p>
<ul>
<li>Key workers may seek better-paid employment abroad</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Trade restrictions on their products</p>
<ul>
<li>Tariffs make it difficult for developing countries to sell their products at home and abroad.</li>
<li>Tariffs also build up as the goods are processed into higher-value-added goods, so that economies are discouraged from building up their industries</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Unbalanced economies</p>
<ul>
<li>Certain markets may be under-developed such as the financial sector. A lack of developed financial sector is likely to discourage saving and investment</li>

<ul>
<li>Definition: It occurs when people do not have access to basic food, clothing and shelter</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Relative poverty</p>
<ul>
<li>Definition: It occurs when people are poor relative to other people in the country</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Causes of poverty </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Unemployment</p>
<ul>
<li>The unemployed may be poor due to low literacy, unskilled and illness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Low wages</p>
<ul>
<li>Lower GPD per head, poorer the country tends to be due to the low wages in the economy. Low wages may due to unskilled workers, so they may have low wages, low consumption and investment. These results in poverty.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Illness</p>
<ul>
<li>A lack of healthcare reduce life expectancy in a country. The lower the life expectancy, the poorer the country tends to be and so the greater the degree of poverty in the country. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Low literacy rates</p>
<ul>
<li>This measures the proportion of the population aged 15 and above who can read and write</li>
<li>Low-income country tend to have low literacy rates due to lack of sufficient education. This causes high unemployment and low productivity. It is hard to eradicate poverty.</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li><p>Disadvantages of specialisation</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For consumers</p>
<ul>
<li>One or some countries may gain control of most of the global market and restrict supply to push up the price</li>
<li>May not follow the same health and safety standards as the home country</li>
<li>Any problems happened in the country may stop the country from producing so in the short run the product is not available</li>
</ul>

<li><p>For firms</p>
<ul>
<li>Too dependent on other counties for the markets of the products they produce and for the sources of their raw materials</li>
<li>May experience a fall in demand as tastes may change or foreign counties become more efficient or a substitute may be developed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>For the economy</p>
<ul>
<li>Hard to determine what an economy is best at producing and what will be in demand in the future</li>
<li>If demand suddenly falls or costs rise, the country may run into difficulties and results in structural unemployment</li>
<li>High transport costs may also offset any costs advantage a country has in producing</li>
</ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Trade</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Definition: International trade refers to the exchange of goods and services beyond national borders. It entails the sale of exports (goods and services sold to overseas buyers) and imports (foreign goods and services bought by domestic households and firms).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Definition: Free trade means that international trade can take place without any forms of protection (barriers to international trade), such as quantitative limits or taxes being imposed on exports.</p>
<ul>
<li>Advantages </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Connection between specialisation and international trade</p>
<ul>
<li>Producing a relatively narrow range of products will mean that countries will have to export some of their output. This is necessary for them to gain revenue for spending on imports of products that their citizens want to buy, but their countries are not producing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Globalisation</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Definition: Globalisation is the process by which the world’s economies become increasingly interdependent and interconnected due to greater international trade and cultural exchanges. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Consequences</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Advantages</p>
<ul>
<li>With increasing international trade, creating wealth and jobs throughout the world</li>
<li>Increasing competition results in more products at relatively low prices</li>
<li>Encourage firms to locate their production in most efficient locations</li>

<li><p>Multinational company(MNC)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>An MNC in an organisation that operates in two or more countries. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Advantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Foreign country–Through job creation, improve standards of living in the countries</li>
<li>Firms&amp;consumers–MNCs enjoy economies of scale so MNCs can pass on cost savings to their consumers in form of lower prices</li>
<li>Firms&amp;home country–By operating in overseas market, MNCs are able to generate more profits because of an increase in consumer base(profit are repatriated so home country benefits)</li>
<li>Firms&amp;foreign country–MNCs move or expand their operations in foreign countries to benefit from lower rates of corporation tax.</li>
<li>Firms–Spread risks by operating overseas</li>
<li>Firms–Avoid any trade restrictions</li>
<li>Firms–Access new markets by locating overseas and reduce transportation costs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Disadvantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Workers–Unethical and cost-cutting practises</li>
<li>Local companies–MNCs can force local firms that are less competitive to close down because of their huge market power and ability to exploit economies of scale</li>
<li>Local government–They are often in a powerful position to exploit foreign governments over decisions</li>
<li>Local country–Higher unemployment</li>
<li>Local country–Over-reliance on MNCs in low income countries means there are major consequences should an MNC choose to relocate the operation</li>
<li>MNCs– Hard to manage the overall business because of a lack of effective communications</li>
<li>MNCs– Fluctuating exchange rate makes it difficult to measure and compare the value of MNCs’ sales and profits</li>
<li>MNCs– May not provide goods and services appealed to local tastes and consumers</li>

</li>
<li><p>Methods</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Tariff</p>
<ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Embargo</p>
<ul>
<li>It is a ban on trade with a certain country, due to a trade dispute or political conflict</li>
<li>An embargo rarely benefits local consumers as they suffer from a lack of choices and higher prices</li>

<li>Help the infant industries from foreign competition and safeguard domestic jobs, because in extreme cases, fierce competition from foreign rivals can even force domestic firms out of business.</li>
<li>Prevent foreign countries dumping(occurs when foreign firms sell their products in large quantities at prices deliberately below those charged by domestic firms, often even below the cost of production)</li>
<li>Increase government revenue</li>
<li>Overcome a balance of payment deficit as restricting imports will help to deal with it</li>
<li>To protect strategic industries instead of relying on foreign countries</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Disadvantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Government intervention may distort market signals and results in an international misallocation of resources. The domestic companies may become too reliant on government and become inefficient</li>
<li>Decreasing competition and incentive for innovation may lead to an increase in price. Costs of raw materials may increase as well and results in imported inflation</li>
<li>Other countries may react with retaliating and imposing their own barriers. This may hinder global economic growth and prosperity</li>

<h3 id="Exchange-rate"><a href="#Exchange-rate" class="headerlink" title="Exchange rate"></a>Exchange rate</h3><ul>
<li><p>Definition: An exchange rate refers to the price of one currency measured in terms of other currencies. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Determination</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Demand for currency</p>
<ul>
<li>This means that as the value of a country’s currency rises, its demand for imports tends to increase.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Supply of currency</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Floating exchange rate</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Definition: In floating exchange rate, the value of the currency is determined by the market forces of demand for the currency and supply of the currency</p>
</li>
<li><p>Change in exchange rate</p>
<ul>
<li>Definition: An appreciation in the exchange rate if the exchange rate is rising against other currencies</li>
<li>Definition: A depreciation in the exchange rate if the exchange rate is falling against other currencies</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Fixed exchange rate</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Definition: In a fixed exchange rate system, the government intervenes in foreign exchange markets to maintain its exchange rate at a predetermined level</p>
</li>
<li><p>Main advantage: reducing the uncertainties for international trade makes domestic and foreign firms to be certain about future costs and prices and encourages international trade and exchange</p>
</li>
<li><p>This is achieved by the respective government buying and selling foreign currencies</p>
</li>
<li><p>Change in exchange rate</p>
<ul>
<li>Definition: A revaluation in the exchange rate if the exchange rate is rising against other currencies</li>
<li>Definition: A devaluation in the exchange rate if the exchange rate is falling against other currencies</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Causes of exchange rate fluctuations</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Floating exchange rate system</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Changes in demand for exports: An increase in the demand for export will increase the demand for the country’s currency and increase the exchange rate</p>
</li>
<li><p>Changes in demand for imports: An increase in the demand for import will increase the demand for foreign currency and increase the value of foreign currency</p>
</li>
<li><p>Prices and inflation: An increase in the price of goods and services caused by domestic inflation will decrease the demand for exports</p>
</li>
<li><p>Foreign direct investment(FDI): Investment in overseas production plant requires the use of foreign currencies</p>
<ul>
<li>Inward FDI(eg. the entry of an MNC)will boost the demand for a currency</li>
<li>Outward FDI(eg. departure of an MNC)will increase the supply of a currency</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Speculation: foreign exchange traders and investment companies move money around the world to take advantage of higher interest rates and variations in exchange rates to earn a profit. As huge sums of money(hot money)are involved, speculation can cause exchange rate fluctuations. They might lack confidence and therefore withdraw their investment and depreciate the currency</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Fixed exchange rate system</p>
<ul>
<li>Government intervention</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Consequences of appreciation and revaluation</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Advantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Consumers will have greater purchasing power</li>
<li>Importers gain from a strong dollar because the raw materials, components and finished goods will be cheaper. But this is bad for domestic producers</li>
<li>As unemployment decreases, the inflation rate will decrease. Also, if the country relies heavily on imports, the higher exchange rate will reduce general price level</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Disadvantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Exporters may face difficulties as exchange rate increases caused by their goods and services become more expensive for foreign consumers</li>
<li>A fall in net exports and deteriorating profits will cause job losses in export-oriented businesses and increase unemployment</li>
<li>In the long run, as a result of the higher exchange rate, economic growth is likely to fall due to the combination of lower export sales and higher unemployment.</li>
<li>If a currency appreciation has a larger impact on exports than imports (that is, there is a fall in the value of net exports), then the balance of payments will worsen, as a strong currency will make it more difficult for exporters to sell their goods and services in overseas markets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Coping with a strong exchange rate</p>
<ul>
<li>Cutting export prices to maintain their price competitiveness against foreign rivals</li>
<li>Seeking alternative suppliers of cheaper raw materials</li>
<li>Improving productivity to keep costs of production low</li>
<li>Provide more price inelastic demand products as consumers are not sensitive with price change caused by exchange fluctuations</li>
<li>Improving non-price factors, including brand awareness and social responsibility</li>
<li>Relocate the production process overseas</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Primary income</p>
<ul>
<li>Definition: It is the income earned by people working in different countries and investment income which comes into and goes out of the country</li>
<li>Example: Money sent home by people working abroad</li>

<ul>
<li>Definition: It is the transfers between residents and non-residents of money, goods or services, not in return for anything else</li>

<li><p>Deficit</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Definition: A current account deficit occurs when its import expenditure is greater than its export earnings(the current account has a negative balance)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Causes</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Lower demand for exports</p>
<ul>
<li>A decline in manufacturing competitiveness(may caused by higher labour costs domestically)</li>
<li>A decline income in foreign market(may due to a decrease in available money caused by an economic recession)</li>
<li>An increase in exchange rate which makes exports more expensive and reduce the volume and value of exports</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Higher demand for imports</p>
<ul>
<li>Cheaper or better quality of imports(cheaper may due to a decrease in exchange rate)</li>
<li>Domestic inflation which makes imports relatively cheaper</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Consequences</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Advantages</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Lower exchange rate</p>
<ul>
<li>The demand for the domestic currency decreases so the exchange rate decreases and exports become more competitive</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Disadvantages</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Reduced demand</p>
<ul>
<li>As the economy is spending more on imports that it is receiving, the demand in economy will fall and a recession may be triggered</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Unemployment</p>
<ul>
<li>A fall in overall demand may cause cyclical unemployment. Also, the wages may decrease</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Lower standards of living</p>
<ul>
<li>The deficit may be caused by capital outflows exceed capital inflows. The economy may suffer from lower standards of living as income is less. Also, households and firms may need to reduce spending</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Increased borrowing</p>
<ul>
<li>Deficit means spending more than income. Government needs to borrow money to overcome the difference which results in interest and repayment of the loan(any money which government spends has an opportunity cost)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Surplus</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Definition: A current account deficit occurs when its export earning is greater than its import expenditure(the current account has a positive balance)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Causes</p>
<ul>
<li><p>High demand for exports</p>
<ul>
<li>An improvement in manufacturing competitiveness(may caused by higher labour productivity in domestic economy)</li>
<li>Higher incomes in overseas markets</li>
<li>A decrease in exchange rate</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Low demand for imports</p>
<ul>
<li>Imports are more expensive or of a lower quality</li>
<li>Inflation in overseas countries causes import tend to be expensive</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Consequences</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Advantages</p>
<ul>
<li>A fall in unemployment in domestic economy, but an increase in unemployment in other countries</li>
<li>The country receive high income because the home country has a competitive advantage in the product they export and result in a better living standards</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Disadvantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Higher demand for exports may lead to demand-pull inflation and diminish the international competitiveness</li>
<li>Higher demand for exports can cause the currency to appreciate in value and foreign buyers will find it more expensive to import goods into their countries.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Policies to achieve balance of payment stability</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Fiscal policy</p>
<ul>
<li>Higher taxes and reduced government spending to decrease the amount of money available to spend on imports</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Monetary policy</p>
<ul>
<li>Floating–Higher interest rates make new and existing loans more expensive for households and firms to reduce demand for imports</li>
<li>Fixed– The central monetary authority of a country might decide to devalue the exchange rate to improve the nation’s competitiveness</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Supply-side policy</p>
<ul>
<li>To raise the productive capacity</li>
<li>Investment in education and healthcare services to improve human capital, productivity and competitiveness</li>
<li>Investment in infrastructure to support</li>
<li>Encourage export-drive business start-ups and industries</li>
